For usage instruction and basic examples see getting-started section . HK2 \u00b6 Many people ask why not just use HK2 instead of guice as it's already provided. Unfortunately, it's hard to use it in the same elegant way as we can use guice. HK2 context is launched too late (after dropwizard run phase) and, for example, it is impossible to use HK2 to instantiate dropwizard managed objects because managed must be registered before HK2 context starts. Guicey use lazy factories for integration: it register providers for HK2 objects in guice context. Guice-managed objects (extensions) are simply registered as instances. So most of the time you don't have to know about HK2 at all. There are additional features allowing you to delegate some extensions management completely to HK2 , but it's intended to be used in very rare cases (edge cases!). In this case you may require to explicitly register hk2-guice bride so hk2 could see guice beans directly. Danger Since jersey 2.26 it is possible to get rid of HK2 completely. Next guicey version will ONLY use guice and all current HK2-related features will be removed. Lifecycle \u00b6 Dropwizard declares two phases: initialization ( App.initialize method) - when dropwizard app must be configured run ( App.run method) - when configuration is available and extensions could be registered in environment Guicey follow dropwizard convention: it will configure everything (almost) on initialization phase and start injector on run phase . Note If we create injector in initialization phase then we will not have access to Configuration and Environment in guice modules, but configuration could be required, especially for 3 rd party modules, which does not support lazy configuration. The only exception for configuration under initialization phase is guice modules, which can be registered in run phase (simply because modules too often require configuration values for construction). As a consequence, extensions recognized from guice bindings are registered in run phase too. This separation of initialization and run phases makes configuration more predictable (especially important when bundles depend on initialization order). Guice module \u00b6 In the main GuiceBundle guice modules registration appears under initialization phase (when neither Configuration nor Environment objects are available). If module require these objects and it's registration can't be moved to guicey bundle's run method, then use marker interfaces . For example, ConfigurationAwareModule will lead to configuration object set into module before injector creation. Tip If possible, use DropwizardAwareModule as base module class to avoid boilerplate public class SampleModule extends DropwizardAwareModule < Configuration > { @Override protected void configure () { configuration () // access configuration environment () // access environment bootstrap () // access dropwizard bootstrap configuratonTree () // configuration as tree of values confuguration ( Class ) // unique sub configuration configuration ( String ) // configuration value by yaml path configurations ( Class ) // sub configuration objects by type (including subtypes) options () // access guicey options } } Warning Marker interfaces work only on modules, directly registered through guicey api. Extensions \u00b6 In raw dropwizard you register extensions like: public class App extends Application < Configuration > { ... @Override public void run ( Configuration configuration , Environment environment ) throws Exception { // resource registration environment . jersey (). register ( MyResource . class ); // if extension requires configuration: environment . lifecycle (). manage ( new MyManaged ( configuration . getSomething ())); } } Very easy, just need to remember where it should be registered. If we want to use guice for extensions management, then all extensions must be obtained from guice injector, but it's a boilerplate. Instead, guicey introduce Extension-Installer concept: you create extension (e.g. MyResource ) and Installer knows how to install it. Guicey only need to know extension class. If you use classpath scanning , then you don't need to do anything: guicey will recognize extensions and install them. For example, ResourceInstaller will: recognize MyResource class as rest resource by @Path annotation gets instance from injector ( injector.getInstance(MyResource.class) ) and performs registration environment.jersey().register(guiceManagedInstance) The same way, MangedInstaller recognize MyManaged as managed extension (by implemented interface) and installs guice managed instance (and so all other extensions). Summary With classpath scan you don't need to do anything to install extension and in manual mode you only need to specify extension classes. Tip Most installer implementations are very simple, so you can easily understand how it works (all core installers are declared in core installers bundle ). Guice bindings \u00b6 Guicey also search extensions in registered guice modules. For example: public class MyModule extends AbstarctModule { @Override protected void configure () { bind ( MyResource . class ); } } GuiceBundle . builder () . modules ( new MyModule ()) . build () MyResource will be recognized as extension and installed. Summary So overall there are 3 possible sources for extensions: Classpath scan (mainly used for application extensions) Manual declaration (used in bundles to explicitly declare extensions) Guice bindings In all cases extension is identifyed by it's class, but for extensions detected from guice bindings automatic untargetted binding is not performed. Jersey extensions \u00b6 It is important to note that jersey extensions ( resources and other ) are forced to be singletons (if explicit scope annotation is not set). This force you to always use all request scoped objects through Provider . But, from the other side, this avoids a jvm garbage from creating them for each request and makes everything a bit faster (no extra DI work required for each request). If you think that developer comfort worth more then small performance gain, then: You can use explicit scope annotations to change singleton scope ( @RequestScoped , @Prototype ) Switch off forced singletons ( .option(InstallerOptions.ForceSingletonForJerseyExtensions, false) ) Delegate some extensions or resources management to HK2 using @JerseyManaged Use HK2 by default for jersey extensions Warning Guice AOP will not work on extensions managed by HK2 Custom extensions \u00b6 Installers are not limited to dropwizard only features: you can use custom installers to write any 3 rd party integration. The only condition is extension classes must have some unique identity (usually annotation). For example, EagerSingletonInstaller simply binds extensions annotated with @EagerSingleton with bind(Ext.class).asEeagerSingleton() , so we can simply annotate class and make sure it would be registered in guice context without additional configurations (thanks to classpath scan). Tip Custom installers are also discovered and registered during classpath scan . Another example is PluginInstaller which allows you to declare plugins (e.g. implementing some interface) and inject all of them at once (as Set<PluginInterface> ). Extensions project provides special installer to register events in guava eventBus : EventBusInstaller check class methods and if any method is annotated with @Subscribe - register extension as event bus listener. Not existing, but possible extension for scheduled tasks: we can create @Schedule annotation and write installer to automatically register such classes in scheduler framework. Summary In essence, custom installers could help you avoid many boilerplate operations. Warning Each extension could be installed only by one installer. It will be the first installer which recognize the extension in class (according to installers order ). Core installers override \u00b6 It is also possible to replace any core installer (e.g. to change it's behaviour) - you just need to disable core installer and install a replacement: bootstrap . addBundle ( GuiceBundle . builder () ... . disableInstaller ( ManagedInstaller . class ) . installers ( MyCustomManagedInstaller . class ) . build ()); Tip You can disable all installers enabled by default with: . noDefaultInstallers () In this case, you will have to register some installers manually (even if it would be just a few of guicey's own installers). Bundles \u00b6 Dropwizard use bundles for re-usable logic. Bundle support both dropwizard phases (initialization and run). public interface ConfiguredBundle < T > { default void initialize ( Bootstrap <?> bootstrap ) {}; default void run ( T configuration , Environment environment ) throws Exception {}; } The concept is great, but, in context of guice, dropwizard bundle did not allow us to register guice modules (and, of course, guicey installers and extensions). So there is no way to elegantly re-use dropwizard bundles mechanism. Guicey introduce it's own bundles: public interface GuiceyBundle { default void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) {}; default void run ( GuiceyEnvironment environment ) throws Exception {}; } As you can see guicey bundles are completely equivalent to dropwizard bundles and so it is very easy to switch from dropwizard bundles into guicey bundles. GuiceyBootstrap provides almost all the same methods as main GuiceBundle , allowing you to register installers, extensions, modules and other bundles. Also, it provides access to dropwizard Bootstrap object GuiceyEnvironment allows to register only guice modules (as all configuration should appear under initialization), but provide many shortcut methods for simplify manual registrations (or delayed manual logic). Provides access to dropwizard configuration, environment and introspected configuration tree. Tip Guicey bundles assume to be used together with dropwizard bundles (because there are already many ready-to use dropwizard bundles): GuiceyBootstrap . builder () . dropwizardBundles (..) Bundles usage difference \u00b6 In dropwizard bundles are helpful not just for extracting re-usable extensions, but for separation of application logic. In guicey, you don't need to write registration code and with enabled classpath scan , don't need to configure much at all. This makes guicy bundles mostly usable for 3 rd party integrations (or core modules extraction for large projects), where you can't (and should not) rely on class path scan and must declare all installers and extensions manually. Many bundle examples could be found in extension modules . Bundles lookup \u00b6 Dropwizard force you to always register bundles manually, and this is good for clarity. But, sometimes, it is desirable to apply bundles under some condition. For example, you want custom installers to be registered when 3 rd party integrations jar is available or you may want to enable some bundles under integration tests only. Guicey provides such ability: add bundles appeared in classpath (with ServiceLoader, not classpath scan) declare extra bundles with system property (for example, could be used in tests) apply custom lookup implementation ServiceLookup based lookup is ideal for 3 rd party integrations. For example, suppose you have scheduler framework integration which provides installers for custom annotation ( @Job ). All you need to do to apply extension is to put integration jar into classpath - installers will be implicitly registered. Important ServiceLookup requires you to prepare extra files so you prepare your bundle for using that way. It does not mean guicey loads all bundles in classpath! Tip ServiceLoader and property based lookups are always enabled, but you can switch them off if required with .disableBundleLookup() bundle option. Disabling items \u00b6 As you have seen in overriding installers example , you can disable installers. But actually you can disable almost anything: installers, extensions, guice modules, guicey bundles and even dropwizard bundles. Mostly this is required for testing (to be able to exclude entire application parts and, maybe, replace with something else). But, in some cases, you may want to change behaviour of 3 rd party module: as an example above (with replaced installer), you can replace extension, guice module (registered by some bundle), or even prevent entire bundle (with transitive bundles) installation. Suppose you have some 3 rd party bundle: public class XBundle implements GuiceyBundle { public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { bootstrap . extensions (...) . modules ( new XModule (), new XAddonModule ()); } } And, for some reason, you don't need XAddonModule guice module, then you can simply disable it: bootstrap . addBundle ( GuiceBundle . builder () . bundles ( new XBundle ()) . disableModules ( XAddonModule . class ) . build ()) Tip You can even perform mass disables by predicate . For example, disable all installations (extensions, bundles etc) from package: . disable ( Disables . inPackage ( \"some.package.here\" )) Warning Disabling of guice modules also affect transitive modules! For example, public class MyModule extends AbstractModule { @Override protected void configure () { // transitive install ( new OtherMyModule ()); } } GuiceBundle . builder () . modules ( new MyModule ()) . disableModules ( OtherMyModule . class ) Will disable transitive module! Warning Only dropwizard bundles, registered through guicey api are visible! For such bundles, guicey will see all transitive bundles too and will be able to disable them: public class MyDwBundle implements ConfiguredBundle { public void initialize ( Bootstrap bootstrap ) { // transitive bundle bootstrap . addBundle ( new OtherMyDwBundle ()); } } GuiceBundle . builder () . dropwizardBundles ( new MyDwBundle ()) . disableDropwziardBundle ( OtherMyDwBundle . class ) Will prevent OtherMyDwBundle bundle installation. De-duplication items \u00b6 Guice modules, guicey bundles and dropwizard bundles are registered by instance. That means that multiple instances of the same type could be registered, for example: . bundles ( new MyBundle (), new MyBndle ()) Sometimes it may be desirable, but sometimes not. For example, there may be some common bundle: public class Feature1Bundle implements GuiceyBundle { public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { bootstrap . bundles ( new CommonBundle ()); ... } } public class Feature2Bundle implements GuiceyBundle { public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { bootstrap . bundles ( new CommonBundle ()); ... } } And duplicate initialization of common bundle may lead to error. In order to detect duplicate instances guicey rely on equals() method. So if two instances of the same type are equal then only one of them will be used and other considered duplicate. So if ComonBundle implement equals everything will work as planned. For completely unique bundles and modules there are pre-defined base classes UniqueGuiceyBundle and UniqueModule ( UniqueDropwizardAwareModule ) accordingly. (e.g. CommonBundle extends UniqueGuiceyBundle ) For cases when it is not possible to change bundle or module class, it could be declared as unique: GuiceBundle . builder () . bundles ( new Feature1Bundle (), new Feature2Bundle ()) . uniqueItems ( ComonBundle . class ) . build () Guice modules limitation Transitive guice modules are not counted! That means in case of de-duplication transitive modules are not visible. Note that \"common bundle\" problem for dropwizard bundles may be solved by simply registering dropwizard bundles through guicey api. Dropwizrd bundles Only dropwizard bundles, registered through guciey api are visible. So if there would be one bundle registered directly in dropwizard and another with guicey api - guicey will not detect duplicate. Options \u00b6 Dropwizard configuration covers most configuration cases, except development specific cases. For example, some trigger may be useful during application testing and be useless on production (so no reason to put it in configuration). Other example is an ability of low level tuning for 3 rd party bundles. Options are developer configurations: either required only for development or triggers set during development and not intended to be changed later. Options are declared with enum (each enum represents options group) with value type declaration to grant safety. Option could be set only in main bundle (in your application class) You can access options anywhere : guice module, guicey bundle, and in any guice service by injecting special service Options report is included into diagnostic report so you can see all option values. For example, guicey use two option groups: GuiceyOptions and InstallersOptions . GuiceyOptions used for storing main bundle configurations like packages to scan, injector stage, HK2 bridge usage etc. That means you have access to all these application configurations from anywhere in your code (for example, you can know if classpath scan is enabled or not in 3 rd party bundle). Another good example is InstallersOptions.JerseyExtensionsManagedByGuice which changes the way jersey extensions are handled: with guice or with HK2. This is developer time decision and must be selected by developer (because it affects behaviour a lot). Thanks to generic mechanism other bundles could know what was chosen. HK2 usage is highly dependent on HK2-guice-bridge presence and with option we can verify it: Preconditions . checkState ( options . get ( GuiceyOptions . UseHkBridge ), \"HK2 guice bridge is required!\" ) Options lookup \u00b6 You can bind option to system property in order to introduce special \"hidden\" application flag: GuiceBuilder . builder () ... . options ( new OptionsMapper () . prop ( \"myprop\" , Myoptions . SomeOption ) . map ()) . build () Now you can run application with -Dmyprop=value and this value will be mapped to option (accessible everywhere in the application). Note There are built-in basic value conversions from string, but in complex cases you can do manual conversion . prop ( \"myprop\" , Myoptions . SomeOption , val -> convertVal ( val )) Note You can map options from sys properties, environment variables or strings (obtained somewhere else). You can even allow mass binding to allow external definition of any option .props(\"prefix\") . See options lookup doc. Configuration hooks \u00b6 Guicey provides special configuration hooks mechanism which may be used to change application configuration. It is useful for tests or to attach various diagnostic tools for compiled application. For example, out of the box guicey provides DiagnosticHook , which activates diagnostic reporting (print* methods). It may be enabled even on compiled application with a system property: -Dguicey.hooks=diagnostic The same way you can write your hooks and register them with shortcuts ( GuiceBundle.builder().aliasHook(\"tool\", ToolHook.class) ). You don't need to remember all this \u00b6 All guicey features could be revealed from main bundle methods. So you don't need to remember everything - just look methods. There is a special group of print[Something] methods, which are intended to help you understand internal state (and help with debugging). As you have seen, real life configuration could be quite complex because you may have many extensions, observed with classpath scan, bundles, bundles installing other bundles, many gucie modules. Also, some bundles may disable extensions, installers, guice modules (and some modules could even override bindings). During startup guicey tracks all performed configurations and you can even access this information at runtime using @Inject GuiceyConfigurationInfo info . Out of the box, guicey could print all this into console, you just need to add: bootstrap . addBundle ( GuiceBundle . builder () . printDiagnosticInfo () . build ()) And other logs giving you inside look on configuration.

That means that multiple instances of the same type could be registered, for example: . bundles ( new MyBundle (), new MyBndle ()) Sometimes it may be desirable, but sometimes not.

In order to detect duplicate instances guicey rely on equals() method. So if two instances of the same type are equal then only one of them will be used and other considered duplicate. So if ComonBundle implement equals everything will work as planned. For completely unique bundles and modules there are pre-defined base classes UniqueGuiceyBundle and UniqueModule ( UniqueDropwizardAwareModule ) accordingly. (e.g. CommonBundle extends UniqueGuiceyBundle ) For cases when it is not possible to change bundle or module class, it could be declared as unique: GuiceBundle . builder () . bundles ( new Feature1Bundle (), new Feature2Bundle ()) . uniqueItems ( ComonBundle . class ) . build () Guice modules limitation Transitive guice modules are not counted!

Other example is an ability of low level tuning for 3 rd party bundles. Options are developer configurations: either required only for development or triggers set during development and not intended to be changed later. Options are declared with enum (each enum represents options group) with value type declaration to grant safety. Option could be set only in main bundle (in your application class) You can access options anywhere : guice module, guicey bundle, and in any guice service by injecting special service Options report is included into diagnostic report so you can see all option values. For example, guicey use two option groups: GuiceyOptions and InstallersOptions . GuiceyOptions used for storing main bundle configurations like packages to scan, injector stage, HK2 bridge usage etc. That means you have access to all these application configurations from anywhere in your code (for example, you can know if classpath scan is enabled or not in 3 rd party bundle). Another good example is InstallersOptions.JerseyExtensionsManagedByGuice which changes the way jersey extensions are handled: with guice or with HK2. This is developer time decision and must be selected by developer (because it affects behaviour a lot). Thanks to generic mechanism other bundles could know what was chosen.

Note In pure dropwizard, bundles also used inside single application to separate configuration blocks (simplify logic). In guicey, this is not required as classpath scan could be used for extensions registration (configuration amount reduced). This chapter describe only re-usable logc decomposition. In guicey we have: guicey bundle ( GuiceyBundle ), guice module ( Module ) and dropwizard bundle ( ConfiguredBundle ). This could confuse. There are existing dropwizard modules - ConfiguredBundle Existing guice modules (outdated list, just as an exampel) - Module And guicey extensions - GuiceyBundle All these modules are supposed to be used together (obviously). In some cases, guicey explicitly provides wrapping modules (e.g. jdbi - wrapper for dropwizard module), but such wrappers usually provide additional abilities (impossible with pure module) and not driven by inability to use a raw module. Guicey bundle \u00b6 As it was described , guicey have to introduce its own bundle because guicey provides additional configuration features (even in the simplest case you should be able to configure guice modules). Prefer GuiceyBundle over dropwizard Bundle for developing re-usable modules. Of course, if module is very generic (does not depend on guice) you can do pure dropwizard module (to publish it for wider audience), but almost always bundles rely on guicey features. Benefits: guice support (ability to register guice modules) options support could use sub-configration objects directly (important for writing generic modules) ability to introduce new extension types to simplify usage (e.g. like jdbi ) automatic module load when jar appear in classpath (e.g. like lifecycle annotations ) shared state - advanced technique for bundles communications (e.g. used by GSP and SPA ) events - internal lifecycle events for fine-tuning lifecycle (again, complex cases only, for example, GSP use it to order bundles logic) ability to replace functionality (prevent feature x registration by disabling it and register feature y instead) Dropwizard bundle \u00b6 It is important to note that there is a difference between registration of dropwizard bundle directly (in dropwizard Bootstrap ) and through guicey api: bundle registered through guicey api could be disabled , de-duplicated , tracked for transitive bundles . Also, bundles registered through guicey api appear in configuration report . There is a difference between dropwizard and guicey bundles in transitive bundles initialization: Dropwizard bundle immediately initialize transitive bundle: public class MyBundle implements ConfiguredBundle { @Override public void initialize ( Bootstrap <?> bootstrap ) { bootstrap . addBundle ( new MyOtherBundle ()); // line executed after MyOtherBundle init } } Guicey bundle register transitive bundle after current bundle, but dropwizard bundle immediately. public class MyBundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { bootstrap . dropwizardBundles ( new DwBundle ()) . bundles ( new MyOtherBundle ()); // line executed before MyOtherBundle init, but after DwBundle init } } Guicey bundles behaviour explained by de-duplciation logic: registered root bundles must be initialized in priority. It avoids situation like: GuiceBundle . builder () . bundles ( new Bundle1 (), new Bundle2 ( 12 )) If Bundle2 is unique and Bundle1 transitively installs new Bundle2(1) (e.g. with different config), then this transitive bundle would be ignored (because root bundles init will appear first). If it were working like dropwizard bundles, then directly registered Bundle2 would be ignored and remaining instance would have different configuration (confusion point). Normally, this behaviour should not be an issue as you shouldn't rely on bundles initialization order. But this may be important with shared state . Bundle vs Module \u00b6 When extracting functionality into re-usable module always start with a bundle. Guice module, most likely, will be required too. Logic should be separated as: Guice module is responsible for guice bindings and should not be aware of dropwizard. Bundle works with dropwizard: extract required configuration for creating module and do other registrations. That's an ideal case. But, for example, if you need to apply some bindings based on configuration only then you can do it with pure guice module, like: public class ModuleConfig { @JsonProperty private String something ; } Module knows that target application (where this re-usable module would be used) will declare this configuration inside its main configuration: public class AppConfig extends Configuration { @JsonProperty private ModuleConfig module ; } Make module aware of dropwizard staff : public class ModuleImpl < C extends Configuration > extends DropwizardAwareModule < C > { @Override protected void configure () { // obtain sub-configuration object ModuleConfig config = Preconditions . checkNotNull ( configuration ( ModuleConfig . class ), \"ModuleConfig is not found within application config. Please declare it.\" ); // use it for binding bind ( SomeService . class ). annotatedWith ( Names . named ( config . getSomething ())). to ( SomeServiceImpl . class ); } } Warning This is not a recommended way! It was shown just to demonstrate that guice module could be used without bundle. It's better to use declaration bundle instead: public class ModuleImpl extends AbstractBundle { private ModuleConfig config ; public ModuleImpl ( ModuleConfig config ) { this . config = config ; } @Override protected void configure () { bind ( SomeService . class ). annotatedWith ( Names . named ( config . getSomething ())). to ( SomeServiceImpl . class ); } } public class ModuleBundle extends GuiceyBundle { @Override public void run ( GuiceyEnvironment environment ) throws Exception { ModuleConfig config = Preconditions . checkNotNull ( environment . configuration ( ModuleConfig . class ), \"ModuleConfig is not found within application config. Please declare it.\" ); environment . modules ( new ModuleImpl ( config )); } } Bundle tips \u00b6 These tips show various techniques for developing bundles. Mostly, these tips are based on developing guicey extensions . (look extensions sources as examples). Uniqueness \u00b6 For everything that is registered \"by instance\" applied de-duplication mechanism . You can use it to grant only one instance of bundle by extends UniqueGuiceyBundle (or more sophisticated logic by manual equals and hash code implementation , for example, to de-duplicate only instance with the same constructor arguments). It may be mostly important for guice modules as guice will not start with duplicate bundings ( MyModule extends UniqueModule ). Auto-loaded bundle \u00b6 Auto loading based on guicey bundles lookup . Be aware that user may switch off bundles lookup (with .disableBundleLookup() ) or apply custom lookup ). Auto load override \u00b6 If your bundle provides configuration, but you still want to load it automatically with the default configuration, then you can use bundle uniquness : public class AutoLoadableBundle extends UniqueGuiceyBundle { ... } Now only one bundle instance is allowed and, if user register bundle manually, bundle from lookup will simply be ignored. Lifecycle annotations module use this technique. Optional extensions \u00b6 All extensions must be registered under initialization phase, when configuration is not yet available and so it is not possible to implement optional extension registration. To workaround this, you can conditionally disable extensions: public class MyFeatureBundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { // always register extension bootstrap . extensions ( OptionalExtension . class ); } @Override public void run ( GuiceyEnvironment environment ) throws Exception { // disable extension based on configuration value if ( ! environment . configuration (). getSomeValue ()) { environment . disableExtension ( OptionalExtension . class ); } } } Replace features \u00b6 As bundle has almost complete access to configuration, it can use disables to substitute application functions. For example, it is known that application use ServiceX (from some core module in organization), but this bundle requires modified service. It can disable core module, installing feature and register customized module: public class MyFeatureBundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { bootstrap . disableModules ( CoreModule . class ) . modules ( new CustomizedCoreModule ()); } } Note It's not the best example: of course it's simpler to use binding override to override single service. But it's just to demonstrate the idea (it could be repalced extension or fixed installer). Bundles can't disable other bundles (because target bundle could be already processed at this point). Bundle options \u00b6 Bundle could use guicey options mechanism to access guicey option values: public class MyBundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { if ( bootstrap . option ( GuiceyOptions . UseHkBridge )) { // show warning that bridge required } } } Or it could be some custom options usage. Note Option values are set only in main GuiceBundle and so all bundles see the same option values (no one can change values after). Configuration access \u00b6 Bundle could access not only direct dropwizard Configuration , but also individual values thanks to yaml values introspection. Unique sub config \u00b6 When creating re-usable bundle it is often required to access yaml configuration data. Usually this is solved by some \"configuration lookups\" like in dropwizard-views Guicey allows you to obtain sub-configuration object directly: public class XFeatureBundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void run ( GuiceyEnvironment environment ) throws Exception { XFeatureConfig environment = bootstrap . configuration ( XFeatureConfig . class ); ... } } Note that this bundle doesn't known exact type of user configuration, it just assumes that XFeatureConfig is declared somewhere in configuration (on any level) just once. For example: public class MyConfig extends Configuration { @JsonProperty private XFeatureConfig xfeature ; ... } Important Your sub configuration object must appear only once within user configuration. Object uniqueness checked by exact type match, so if configuration also contains some extending class ( XFeatureConfigExt extends XFeatureConfig ) it will be different unique config. Access by path \u00b6 When you are not sure that configuration is unique, you can rely on exact path definition (of required sub configuration): public class XFeatureBundle implements GuiceyBundle { private String path ; public XFeatureBundle ( String path ) { this . path = path ; } @Override public void run ( GuiceyEnvironment environment ) throws Exception { XFeatureConfig conf = environment . configuration ( path ); ... } } Path is declared by bundle user, who knows required configuration location: GuiceBundle . builder () . bundles ( new XFeatureBundle ( \"sub.feature\" )) ... . build () Where public class MyConfig extends Configuration { @JsonProperty private SubConfig sub = { // pseudo code to combine class declarations @JsonProperty private XFeatureConfig feature ; } ... } Multiple configs \u00b6 In case, when multiple config objects could be declared in user configuration, you can access all of them: public class XFeatureBundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void run ( GuiceyEnvironment environment ) throws Exception { List < XFeatureConfig > confs = environment . configurations ( XFeatureConfig . class ); ... } } For configuration public class MyConfig extends Configuration { @JsonProperty private XFeatureConfig xfeature ; @JsonProperty private XFeatureConfig xfeature2 ; ... } It wil return both objects: [xfeature, xfeature2] Important In contrast to unique configurations, this method returns all subclasses too. So if there are XFeatureConfigExt extends XFeatureConfig declared somewhere it will also be returned. Custom configuration analysis \u00b6 In all other cases (with more complex requirements) you can use ConfigurationTree object which represents introspected configuration paths. public class XFeatureBundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void run ( GuiceyEnvironment environment ) throws Exception { // get all properties of custom configuration (ignoring properties from base classes) List < ConfigPath > paths = environment . configurationTree () . findAllRootPathsFrom ( MyConfig . class ); // search for not null values of marked (annotated) classes List markedTypes = paths . stream () . filter ( it -> it . getValue () != null && it . getType (). getValueType (). hasAnnotation ( MyMarker . class )) . map ( it -> it . getValue ()) . collect ( Collectors . toList ()); ... } } In this example, bundle search for properties declared directly in MyConfig configuration class with not null value and annotated (classes annotated, not properties!) with custom marker ( @MyMarker ). See introspected configuration structure description . Shared state \u00b6 Guicey maintains special shared state object useful for storing application-wide data. Warning Yes, any shared state is a \"hack\". Normally, you should avoid using it. Guicey provides this ability to unify all such current and future hacks: so if you need to communicate between bundles - you don't need to reinvent the wheel and don't have additional problems in tests (due to leaking states). For example, it is used by spa bundle to share list of registered application names between all spa bundle instances and so be able to prevent duplicate name registration. Server pages bundle use shared state to maintain global configuration and allow application bundles communication with global views bundle. Equal communication scenario \u00b6 Case when multiple (equal) bundles need to communicate. In this case first initialized bundle init shared state and others simply use it. public class EqualBundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { // either obtain already shared object or share new object SomeState state = bootstrap . sharedState ( EqualBundle , () -> new SomeState ()); ... } } Parent-child scenario \u00b6 Case when there is one global bundle, which must initialize some global state and child bundles, which use or appends to this global state. public class GlobalBundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { // share global state object bootstrap . shareState ( GlobalBundle , new GlobalState ()); } } public class ChildBundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { // access shared object or fail when not found GlobalState state = environment . sharedStateOrFail ( GlobalBundle , \"Failed to obtain global state - check if global bundle registered\" ); } } Before/after run logic \u00b6 If multiple bundles must be synchronized on run phase, use guicey events . To run code after all guicey bundles initialization, but before run: @Override public void initialize ( final GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { bootstrap . listen ( new GuiceyLifecycleAdapter () { @Override protected void beforeRun ( final BeforeRunEvent event ) { // do something before bundles run // NOTE that environment and configuration already available! } }); } To run code after all guicey bundles run methods (delayed init): @Override public void run ( final GuiceyEnvironment environment ) { environment . listen ( new GuiceyLifecycleAdapter () { @Override protected void bundlesStarted ( final BundlesStartedEvent event ) { // still sdropwizard run phase (anything could be configured) // but all guicey bundles aready executed } }); } Note This will work only for guicey bundles! Registered dropwizard bundles may execute before or after these events: events broadcast from main dropwizard GuiceBundle run method, so other dropwizard bundles, registered after guice bundle will run after it. It is assumed that guicey bundles used for most configurations (especially in complex cases when bundles synchronization is required)).","title":"Decomposition"},{"location":"decomposition/#decomposition","text":"Guide for writing re-usable bundles In dropwizard we have only one decomposition element: ConfiguredBundle .

Auto configuration (activated with enableAutoConfig ) means that guicey will search for extensions in application package and subpackages. Extension classes are detected by \"feature markers\": for example, resources has @Path annotation, tasks extends Task etc. Tip You can declare multiple packages for classpath scan: . enableAutoConfig ( \"com.mycompany.foo\" , \"com.mycompany.bar\" ) Application could be launched by simply running main class (assume you will use IDE run command): SampleApplication server Note config.yml is not passed as parameter because we don't need additional configuration now Add resource \u00b6 Creating custom rest resource: @Path ( \"/sample\" ) @Produces ( \"application/json\" ) public class SampleResource { @GET @Path ( \"/\" ) public Response ask () { return Response . ok ( \"ok\" ). build (); } } Now, when you run application, you can see that resource was installed automatically: INFO [2017-02-05 11:23:31,188] io.dropwizard.jersey.DropwizardResourceConfig: The following paths were found for the configured resources: GET /sample/ (ru.vyarus.dropwizard.guice.examples.rest.SampleResource) Call http://localhost:8080/sample/ to make sure it works. Tip Rest context is mapped to root by default. To change it use configuration file: server : rootPath : '/rest/*' Resource is a guice bean, so you can use guice injection inside it. To access request specific objects like request, response, jersey javax.ws.rs.core.UriInfo etc. use Provider : @Path ( \"/sample\" ) @Produces ( \"application/json\" ) public class SampleResource { @Inject private Provider < HttpServletRequest > requestProvider ; @GET @Path ( \"/\" ) public Response ask () { final String ip = requestProvider . get (). getRemoteAddr (); return Response . ok ( ip ). build (); } } Now resource will return caller IP. Warning Providers must be used instead of @Context field injections But @Context can be used for method parameters Note By default, resources are forced to be singletons (when no scope annotation defined). Add managed \u00b6 Dropwizard managed objects are extremely useful for managing resources. Create simple managed implementation: @Singleton public class SampleBootstrap implements Managed { private final Logger logger = LoggerFactory . getLogger ( SampleBootstrap . class ); @Override public void start () throws Exception { logger . info ( \"Starting some resource\" ); } @Override public void stop () throws Exception { logger . info ( \"Shutting down some resource\" ); } } It will be automatically discovered and installed. Guicey always reports installed extensions (when they are not reported by dropwizard itself).

Moreover, guice servlet module is not able to register async filters and servlets . Add sample filter around rest methods: @WebFilter ( urlPatterns = \"/*\" ) public class CustomHeaderFilter implements Filter { @Override public void init ( FilterConfig filterConfig ) throws ServletException { } @Override public void doFilter ( ServletRequest request , ServletResponse response , FilterChain chain ) throws IOException , ServletException { if ( \"me\" . equals ( request . getParameter ( \"user\" ))) { chain . doFilter ( request , response ); } else { (( HttpServletResponse ) response ) . sendError ( HttpServletResponse . SC_UNAUTHORIZED , \"Not authorized\" ); } } @Override public void destroy () { } } Filter will pass through only requests with user=me request parameter. It is used just to show how to register custom filters with annotations (implementation itself is not useful).

Add guice module \u00b6 Guice module registration: bootstrap . addBundle ( GuiceBundle . builder () ... . modules ( new SampleModule ()) . build ()); Multiple modules could be registered at once: . modules ( new SampleModule (), new Some3rdPatyModule ()) Note Registration above occur in dropwizard initialization phase, when neither Configuration nor Environment objects are available, but if you need them in module then either register module in guicey bundle's run method or use marker interfaces Manual mode \u00b6 If you don't want to use classpath scan, then you will have to manually specify all extensions. Example above would look in manual mode like this: bootstrap . addBundle ( GuiceBundle . builder () . modules ( new SampleModule ()) . extensions ( SampleResource . class , SampleBootstrap . class , CustomHeaderFilter . class ) . build ()); The only difference is the absence of classpath scan (but you'll have to manually declare all extensions). Tip Explicit extensions declaration could be used together with classpath scan: for example, classpath scan could not cover all packages with extensions (e.g. due to too much classes) and not covered extensions may be specified manually. Note Duplicate extensions are filtered. If some extension is registered manually and also found with auto scan then only one extension instance will be registered. Even if extension registered multiple times manually, only one extension will work. Configuration from bindings \u00b6 Guicey is also able to recognize extensions from declared guice bindings, so manual example above is equal to: bootstrap . addBundle ( GuiceBundle . builder () . modules ( new SampleModule ()) . build ()); public class SampleModule extends AbstractModule { @Override protected void configure () { bind ( SampleResource . class ). in ( Singleton . class ); bind ( SampleBootstrap . class ); bind ( CustomHeaderFilter . clas ); } } Guicey will recognize all (3) bindings and register extensions. The difference with classpath scan or manual declaration is only that guicey will not declare default bindings for extensions (by default, guicey creates untargetted bindings for all extensions: bind(Extension.class) ). Tip One extension may be found by classpath scan, declared manually and in binding, but it would still be considered as single registration (with existing binding). Possible extensions \u00b6 Guicey can recognize and install: Dropwizard tasks Dropwizard managed objects Dropwizard health checks REST resources REST extensions (exception mappers, message body readers etc.) Jersey features Filters , servlets , listeners Eager singletons , without direct guice registration It can even simulate simple plugins . Other extension types may appear with additional modules (e.g. jdbi adds support for jdbi mappers and repositories) or may be added by yourself. Any existing extension integration may be replaced, if it doesn't suite your needs. Tip If you'll feel confusing to understand what guicey use for it's configuration, just enable diagnostic logs: GuiceBundle . builder () . printDiagnosticInfo () ... To see what extensions are supported you can always use: GuiceBundle . builder () . printAvailableInstallers () And to see available guice bindings: GuiceBundle . builder () . printGuiceBindings () Bundles \u00b6 Guicey intended to extend dropwizard abilities (not limit). But to get access for these extended abilities you'll need to use GuiceyBundle instead of dropwizard ConfiguredBundle . Bundles lifecycle and methods are the same , just guicey bundle provide more abilities. Attention This does not mean that dropwizard bundles can't be used! An opposite, guicey provides direct shortcuts for them in it's bundles: public class MyBundle implements GuiceyBundle { default void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { bootstrap . dropwizardBundles ( new MyDropeizardBundle ()); } } Additional features will be available for dropwizard bundles registered through guicey api and they also will appear in reports.

Main objects: io.dropwizard.setup.Bootstrap io.dropwizard.Configuration io.dropwizard.setup.Environment Bindings below are not immediately available as HK2 context starts after guice : javax.ws.rs.core.Application javax.ws.rs.ext.Providers org.glassfish.hk2.api.ServiceLocator org.glassfish.jersey.server.internal.inject.MultivaluedParameterExtractorProvider Request-scoped bindings: javax.ws.rs.core.UriInfo javax.ws.rs.container.ResourceInfo javax.ws.rs.core.HttpHeaders javax.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext javax.ws.rs.core.Request org.glassfish.jersey.server.ContainerRequest org.glassfish.jersey.server.internal.process.AsyncContext javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse Request scoped objects must be used through provider: @Inject Provider < HttpServletRequest > requestProvider ; Warning Pay attention that inside rest resources @Context injection on fields will not work on fields , but will for method arguments. Configuration bindings \u00b6 It is quite common need to access configuration value by path, instead of using entire configuration object. Often this removes boilerplate when one option is used in multiple places, compare: @Inject MyConfiguration config ... // in each usage config . getSub (). getFoo () and @Inject @Config ( \"sub.foo\" ) String foo ; // and use direct value in all places Also, often you have some unique configuration sub object, e.g. public class MyConfig extends Configuration { @JsonProperty AuthConfig auth ; } It may be more convenient to bind it directly, instead of full configuration: @Inject @Config AuthConfig auth ; See complete description in the user guide Warning If not disabled , guicey will always bind all configuration values (including values from base Configuration class). Don't be confused when use custom config report - it just not shows common bindings for simplicity, but they are still applied. Note Use configuration bindings report to see available configuration bindings. It is executed before injector creation and so could be used for problems diagnosis. Bindings may change with configuration values changes (e.g. server section depends on server implementation used). Extensions and AOP \u00b6 As it was mentioned guice knows about extensions either by classpath scan search, manual declaration or guice bindings. Recognition from guice binding is not interesting as you bind it manually. Auto scan and manual declaration are essentially the same: guicey have extension class, which must be bound to guice context . In most cases it would be just bind(Extension.class) (but some installers can do more sophisticated bindings, like plugins installer ). As you can see, in all cases extension is constructed by guice and so AOP features will work. Note While HK2 is still used, instance management may be delegated to HK2 but it is not used in core guicey (just an ability; this is almost never required) All extensions recognized from guice bindings are clearly visible in the configuration report . Servlets and filters \u00b6 GuiceFilter is registered on both main and admin contexts. Guice servlets and filters (registered through ServletModule ) may co-exist with pure servlets and filters: as guice filter intercept both contexts, it would be able to manage request scope for all calls (even rest). When you register servlets and filters directly, their instances will be managed by guice (because they are extensions ), just dispatching will work a bit differently, which is almost never important. As you can see, in case of servlets, AOP features will also be always available. Moreover, scopes will work as expected. Note Web report could show actual mapping difference between pure servlets and GuiceFilter -managed servlets. Startup \u00b6 The only not intuitive step, performed by guicey, is modules analysis : just before injector creation guicey parse all registered modules (using guice SPI ): List < Element > elements = Elements . getElements ( modules ) Note Pay attention that guicey looks only actual bindings before injector creation. And that's why it would not \"see\" JIT bindings (bindings that was not declared and created just because guice found an injection point). This is intentional to force declaration of all important bindings. To avoid re-parsing elements during injector creation, guicey pack all parsed elements as module with: Module module = Elements . getModule ( elements ) And so guicey injector factory will receive this synthetic module. So if you need access to raw module, you can either do it with event or disable modules analysis (but in this case some features would not work) Note Guice bindings override ( Modules.override() ), available through guicey api modulesOverride() , will also cause syntetic module (because overrides are applied before calling injector factory). But this supposed to be used for tests only (just to mention).

This allows complete hk2 avoidance in the future. Right now it means that all direct hk2 classes must be replaced by jersey abstractions (but still hk2 is the only production ready integration) Jersey InjectionManager now bound to guice context instead of hk2 ServiceLocator (locator still can be retrieved from manager) Rename HK2 mentions into jersey (because now jersey is not tied to hk2) @HK2Managed renamed to @JerseyManaged JerseyProviderInstaller (installs classes annotated with @Provider ) changes: ValueParamProvider detected instead of ValueFactoryProvider Supplier detected instead Factory (Factory implementations are not recognized anymore!) org.glassfish.jersey.internal.inject.InjectionResolver detected instead of org.glassfish.hk2.api.InjectionResolver Jersey installers use org.glassfish.jersey.internal.inject.AbstractBinder instead of hk specific org.glassfish.hk2.utilities.binding.AbstractBinder Mark all hk2-related methods and options as deprecated (to be removed in the next version) Jersey 2.26 implements jax-rs 2.1 which forced it to change some of it's apis. org.glassfish.jersey.server.AsyncContext binding used instead of org.glassfish.jersey.server.internal.process.AsyncContext (breaking dw 2.0) Deprecated Bundle usages replaced with ConfigurableBundle (in new dropwizard version Bundle extends ConfigurableBundle ) Guicey configuration scope ConfigSope.DropwizardBundle now use ConfigurableBundle class for marking guice bundle scope instead of Bundle dropwizard-bom now includes only dropwizard modules. All 3 rd party dependencies are moved to dropwizard-dependencies package. So you'll have to update two boms now in order to update dropwizard version. Update hk2 guice-bridge to 2.6.1 (breaking) Guicey configuration and lifecycle changes: GuiceyBundle contract and behaviour changed to match dropwizard lifecycle: GuiceyBundle now contains two methods initialize and run and called according to dropwizard lifecycle. Now guicey bundles are complete replacement for dropwizard bundles, but with good interoperability with pure dropwizard bundles The following guicey initializations were moved into dropwizard configuration phase: Guicey bundles lookup and initialization (to be able to install dropwizard bundles inside guicey bundles) Installers classpath search and instantiation Extensions classpath search and validation (but on run phase it is still possible to disable extensions) Extensions initialization moved outside injector creation scope. It will affect time report and, in case of extension installation error, exception will be thrown directly instead of Guice's CreationException. A lot of guicey lifecycle events obviously changed (and new added) Add special ApplicationStarted event: always fired after complete dropwizard startup. Supposed to be used to simplify diagnostic reporting. Support lifecycle listeners deduplication for correct report behaviour in case of multiple registrations. LinkedHashSet used as listeners holder, so only proper equals and hashcode methods implementation is required for deduplication Removed GuiceyOptions.ConfigureFromDropwizardBundles option because it's useless with new bundles lifecycle. (if required, the same behaviour may be implemented with custom bundles lookup) Removed GuiceyOptions.BindConfigurationInterfaces option (interfaces are already bound with @Config qualifier) Guicey web installers ( WebInstallersBundle ) enabled by default. GuiceBundle.builder()#useWebInstallers() option removed Direct dropwizard bundles support: bundles could be registered directly in main bundle ( GuiceBundle.dropwizardBundles() ) or inside guicey bundle ( GuiceyBundle.dropwizardBundles() ). These bundles could be disabled (same as guicey bundles - with .disableDropwizardBundles() methods) and are show in reporting. Transitive dropwizard bundles tracking: all dropwizard bundles registered through guicey api are tracked for transitive registration with bootstrap proxy. That means that all transitive bundles are shown in reports and any transitive bundle could be disabled (with .disableDropwizardBundle or custom predicate). Also, deduplication checks will work (same as for guicey bundles and guice modules). Tracking may be disabled with GuieyOptions.TrackDropwizardBundles option. Allow registration of multiple instances for guice modules and guicey bundles (multiple instances of the same class) By default, equal instances of the same type considered duplicate (only one registered). So, to grant uniqueness of bundle or module, implement correct equals method. For custom cases (when custom equals method is impossible), DuplicateConfigDetector may be implemented and registered with GuiceBundle.Builder#duplicateConfigDetector() Legacy behaviour (1 instance per type) could be simulated with: .duplicateConfigDetector(new LegacyModeDuplicatesDetector()) OR method GuiceBundle.Builder#uniqueItems(Class...) may be used to specify exact items to grant uniqueness for ItemId is now used as identity instead of pure Class . ItemId compute object hash string and preserve it for instance identification. Class types does not contain hash in id. Required because even scopes, represented previously as classes now could be duplicated as multiple instances of the same bundle class could be registered. For simplicity, ItemId equals method consider class-only id's equal to any type instance id. Add bundle loops detection: as multiple bundle instances allowed loops are highly possible Entire bundle chain is provided in exception to simplify fixing loops. Add base classes for unique bundles and modules (with correct equals and hash code implementations): UniqueGuiceyBundle and UniqueModule or UniqueDropwizardAwareModule (use class name strings for comparison to correctly detect even instances of classes from different class loaders). Note: no such class for dropwizard bundle because it's useless (if you use guicey - use GuiceyBundle instead and if you need dropwizard bundle - it shouldn't be dependent on guicey classes) Support extensions recognition from guice modules (jersey1-guice style): extensions are detected from declaration in specified guice modules (essentially same as classpath scan, but from bindings) extensions declared in: direct type bindings (all generified or qualified declarations ignored) linked bindings (right part) bind(Something).to(Extension) are also recognized (which must also be non qualified) like in classpath scan @InvisibleForScanner prevents recognition (or bean may be simply qualified) all extension registration types may work together (classpath scan, manual declaration and binding declaration) extensions registered directly (or found by classpath scan) and also bound manually in guice module will not conflict anymore (as manual declaration would be detected) and so @LazyBinding workaround is not needed extensions declared in guice module may be also disabled (guicey will remove binding declaration in this case and all chains leading to this declartion to prevent possible context failures) Transitive gucie modules (installed by other modules) may be disabled with usual disableModules() (but only if guice bindings analysis is not disabled). enabled by default, but can be disabled with GuiceyOptions.AnalyzeModules option BindingInstaller interface changed (because of direct guice bindings): it now contains 3 methods for class binding, manual binding validation and reporting Extension classes loaded by different class loaders now detected as duplicate extension registration Guicey hooks, initially supposed to be used for testing only, now considered to be also used for diagnostic tools Add guicey hooks lookup from system property guicey.hooks as comma-separated list of classes. Add hook aliases support: alias name assumed to be used instead of full class name in system property ( -Dguicey.hooks ). Alias registered with GuiceBundle.builder()#hookAlias() . All registered aliases are logged at startup. Add diagnostic hook, which enables diagnostic reports and lifecycle logs. Could be enabled with system property: -Dguicey.hooks=diagnostic (where diagnostic is pre-registered hook alias) Useful to enable diagnostic logs on compiled (deployed) application. (breaking) Removed hooks recognition on registered GuiceyLifecycleLister (as it was very confusing feature) Add shared configuration state (for special configuration-time needs like bundles communication). This is required only in very special cases. But such unified place will replace all current and future hacks. Static access by application: SharedConfigurationState.get(app) or SharedConfigurationState.lookup(app, key) Static access by environment: SharedConfigurationState.get(env) or SharedConfigurationState.lookup(env, key) Value access from guicey bundle: boostrap.sharedState(key, defSupplier) , environment.sharedState(key) Value access from DropwizardAwareModule : sharedState Hooks can use GuiceBundle.Builder.withSharedState to access application state. (breaking) InjectorLookup now use global shared state clear() method removed, but SharedConfigurationState.clear() could be used instead (breaking) Test support changes Rename test extensions for guicey hooks registration: GuiceyConfigurationRule into GuiceyHooksRule @UseGuiceyConfiguration (spock extension) into @UseGuiceyHooks (breaking) Reporting changes All reports moved into one top-level debug package. All guicey reports are now guicey lifecycle listeners DiagnosticBundle bundle become ConfigurationDiagnostic guicey listener. Reporters are no more bound to guice context (they could always be constructed manually). DebugGuiceyLifecycle listener renamed into LifecycleDiagnostic Guicey reports (listeners) properly implement equals and hashcode in order to use new deduplicatation mechanism and avoid reports duplication (for example, if .printDiagnosticInfo() would be called multiple times, only one report would be shown; but still different configurations will be reported separately (e.g. list .printDiagnosticInfo() and .printAvailableInstallers() which internally use one listener)) Report all diagnostic reports as one log message in order to differentiate .printDiagnosticInfo() and .printAvailableInstallers() reports when both active Diagnostic report changes ( .printDiagnosticInfo() ): Show both dropwizard and guicey bundles together (dropwizard bundles marked with DW) Always show \"empty\" bundles (bundles without sub registrations) - important for dw bundles Add \"-\" before ignored or disabled items (to visually differentiate from accepted items) Identify instance deduplication: Instead of registrations count (REG(2)) show exact counter of all registered and accepted items: REG(5/12) Show ignored items even in context where items of the same type were accepted Show exact number of ignored items in context (DUPLICATE(3)) Show extension recognized from guice bindings (as sub report) Stats report improved: Show guice internal stat logs in stats diagnostic report (intercept guice logs) Show guicey time by phases (init/run/jersey) Show guice modules analysis stats Show installer marker interfaces in printAvailableInstallers() report to indicate installer actions (installation by type or instance, custom guice or jersey bindings, options support).

Used to generify core guicey options, provide runtime options access (for bundles and reporting) and allow 3 rd party bundles use it's own low-level options. GuiceyBootstrap option(option) method provides access to defined options from bundles Options guice bean provide access to options from guice services Installers could access options by implementing WithOptions interface OptionsInfo guice bean used for accessing options metadata (also accessible through GuiceyConfigurationInfo.getOptions()) Options reporting added to DiagnosticBundle (breaking) remove GuiceBunldle methods: searchCommands(boolean), configureFromDropwizardBundles(boolean), bindConfigurationInterfaces(boolean) (use either shortcuts without parameters or generic options method instead) (breaking) core installers bundle now always installed (for both auto scan and manual modes). May be disabled with GuiceyOptions.UseCoreInstallers option (breaking) configuration info api (GuiceyConfigurationInfo.getData()) changed to use java8 Predicate instead of guava (breaking) InjectorLookup changed to use java8 Optional instead of guava Add ability to customize guice filter mapping DispatcherTypes (by default only REQUEST): GuiceyOptions.GuiceFilterRegistration option Add ability to disable guice filter registration and guice servlet modules support (no request and session scopes, but request and response still may be injected in resources) Jersey request specific services UriInfo, HttpHeaders, SecurityContext, Request, ContainerRequest, AsyncContext no longer bound in request scope (scope controlled by HK2) Add methods to GuiceBundle builder: option(option, value) - used to specify custom option value options(Map) - used to provide multiple options at once (for custom options lookup mechanisms) printAvailableInstallers() - diagnostic reporting configured to show only available installers (to easily spot available features) useWebInstallers() - shortcut for installing WebInstallersBundle noGuiceFilter() - disables guice filter installation for both contexts and guice servlet modules support noDefaultInstallers() - disables CoreInstallersBundle automatic installation 3.3.0 (2016-08-02) \u00b6 Update to guice 4.1.0 Update to dropwizard 0.9.3 Grant compatibility with guice options: disableCircularProxies, requireExactBindingAnnotations and requireExplicitBindings ResourceInstaller looks for @Path on directly implemented interface (#10) Fix bundles lookup reporting (correct multiline) Fix duplicate extensions installation when registered both manually and by auto scan Restrict extension installation to one installer (first matching, according to installers order) Improve dropwizard configuration class binding: Complete configuration hierarchy bound (root, all classes between root and Configuration and Configuration itself) (optional) Bind interfaces directly implemented by classes in configuration hierarchy except interfaces from java and groovy packages (it's common to use HasSomeConfig interface convention and now interface may be directly used for binding (when bindConfigurationInterfaces())) Add GuiceyBootstrap methods (extend GuiceyBundle abilities): bundles(): add transitive guicey bundles support (to install other guicey bundles from bundle). Duplicate bundles are detected by type. application(): returns current application instance Rewrite internal configuration mechanism (bundles, installers etc) to generalize it and introduce complete configuration tracking: store registration sources, disabling, used installers and other specific information for each item Add GuiceyConfigurationInfo service to access tracked guicey configuration information (may be used for configuration diagnostic purposes, performing post configuration checks, printing complete configuration tree etc) Add DiagnosticBundle to log configuration items diagnostic information. Log format is configurable. Rendering is externalized and may be re-used (e.g. for web page). Add GuiceBundle builder configuration options: bindConfigurationInterfaces() to enable configuration interface bindings strictScopeControl() is shortcut to enable HK2DebugBundle (to control beans creation scope during development and tests) printDiagnosticInfo() is shortcut to enable DiagnosticBundle with default preset (enable diagnostic logs) shortcut methods for disabled boolean options: searchCommands(), configureFromDropwizardBundles() and bindConfigurationInterfaces() NOTE: if used FeaturesHolder (internal api bean), now it's renamed to ExtensionsHolder to force upgrade: use new GuiceyConfigurationInfo bean instead (public api) 3.2.0 (2016-01-23) \u00b6 Clear possible duplicate guicey bundle instances Add GuiceyBundleLookup to automatically resolve and install guicey bundles from various sources. Default: check 'guicey.bundles' system property and install bundles described there. May be useful for tests to enable debug bundles. Default: use ServiceLoader mechanism to load declared GuiceyBundle services. Useful for automatic loading of third party extensions. Add builder bundleLookup method to register custom lookup implementation Add builder disableBundleLookup to disable default lookups Default lookup implementation logs all resolved bundles Fix JerseyProviderInstaller: prevent HK2 beans duplicate instantiations; fix DynamicFeature support. Add HK2DebugBundle. When enabled, checks that beans are instantiated by guice only and annotated with @HK2Managed are managed by HK2 only. May be used in tests as extra validation. Add JerseyFeatureInstaller (included in code bundle) which installs javax.ws.rs.core.Feature. Useful for low level configuration. Update to dropwizard 0.9 Revert system exit on guice injector creation error (added in 3.1.1) 3.1.1 (2015-11-24) \u00b6 Exit on guice injector creation error.

Default installers are ordered now with indexes from 10 to 100 with gap 10 (to simplify custom installers injection between them) 2.1.2 (2015-03-03) \u00b6 Spock 1.0 compatibility 2.1.1 (2015-01-25) \u00b6 Dropwizard 0.8-rc2 compatibility 2.1.0 (2015-01-04) \u00b6 Add ability to customize injector creation (required by some guice third party modules, like governator). Contributed by Nicholas Pace Add spock extensions to use injections directly in specification (like spock-guice do) 2.0.0 (2014-11-25) \u00b6 Dropwizard 0.8 integration (as result, no more depends on jersey-guice, but depends on guice-bridge(HK2)). Jersey integration completely rewritten. Add JerseyInstaller installer type Add @LazyBinding annotation, which allows extension not to be registered in guice context (it will be created on first request) 1.1.0 (2014-10-23) \u00b6 Fix interface generics resolution to support nested generics and moved generics resolution into GenericsUtils instead of FeatureUtils Drop java 1.6 compatibility, because dropwizard is 1.7 compatible Add junit rule for lightweight testing (run guice without starting jetty) 1.0.0 (2014-10-14) \u00b6 Add dependency on guice-multibindings Installers may choose now from three types of installation (binding, type or instance) or combine them. Add PluginInstaller: shortcut for multibindings mechanism Updated guice (4.0.beta4 -> 4.0.beta5) Force singleton for resources @Eager renamed to @EagerSingleton and now forces singleton scope for bean Add dropwizard style reporting for installed features (like resources or tasks) Removed JerseyInjectableProviderInstaller. Now injectable providers must be annotated with @Provider Add extensions ordering support using @Order annotation (by default for LifeCycle and Managed installers) Add admin context filter and servlet installers Rename bundle options: features -> installers, disabledFeatures -> disabledInstallers, beans -> extensions 0.9.0 (2014-09-05) \u00b6 Initial release","title":"Version history"},{"location":"about/history/#510-2020-06-02","text":"Update guice to 4.2.3 ( java 14 support ) Update to dropwizard 2.0.10 Add junit 5 extensions (#74).

This allows complete hk2 avoidance in the future. Right now it means that all direct hk2 classes must be replaced by jersey abstractions (but still hk2 is the only production ready integration) Jersey InjectionManager now bound to guice context instead of hk2 ServiceLocator (locator still can be retrieved from manager) Rename HK2 mentions into jersey (because now jersey is not tied to hk2) @HK2Managed renamed to @JerseyManaged JerseyProviderInstaller (installs classes annotated with @Provider ) changes: ValueParamProvider detected instead of ValueFactoryProvider Supplier detected instead Factory (Factory implementations are not recognized anymore!) org.glassfish.jersey.internal.inject.InjectionResolver detected instead of org.glassfish.hk2.api.InjectionResolver Jersey installers use org.glassfish.jersey.internal.inject.AbstractBinder instead of hk specific org.glassfish.hk2.utilities.binding.AbstractBinder Mark all hk2-related methods and options as deprecated (to be removed in the next version) Jersey 2.26 implements jax-rs 2.1 which forced it to change some of it's apis. org.glassfish.jersey.server.AsyncContext binding used instead of org.glassfish.jersey.server.internal.process.AsyncContext (breaking dw 2.0) Deprecated Bundle usages replaced with ConfigurableBundle (in new dropwizard version Bundle extends ConfigurableBundle ) Guicey configuration scope ConfigSope.DropwizardBundle now use ConfigurableBundle class for marking guice bundle scope instead of Bundle dropwizard-bom now includes only dropwizard modules. All 3 rd party dependencies are moved to dropwizard-dependencies package. So you'll have to update two boms now in order to update dropwizard version. Update hk2 guice-bridge to 2.6.1 (breaking) Guicey configuration and lifecycle changes: GuiceyBundle contract and behaviour changed to match dropwizard lifecycle: GuiceyBundle now contains two methods initialize and run and called according to dropwizard lifecycle. Now guicey bundles are complete replacement for dropwizard bundles, but with good interoperability with pure dropwizard bundles The following guicey initializations were moved into dropwizard configuration phase: Guicey bundles lookup and initialization (to be able to install dropwizard bundles inside guicey bundles) Installers classpath search and instantiation Extensions classpath search and validation (but on run phase it is still possible to disable extensions) Extensions initialization moved outside injector creation scope. It will affect time report and, in case of extension installation error, exception will be thrown directly instead of Guice's CreationException. A lot of guicey lifecycle events obviously changed (and new added) Add special ApplicationStarted event: always fired after complete dropwizard startup. Supposed to be used to simplify diagnostic reporting. Support lifecycle listeners deduplication for correct report behaviour in case of multiple registrations. LinkedHashSet used as listeners holder, so only proper equals and hashcode methods implementation is required for deduplication Removed GuiceyOptions.ConfigureFromDropwizardBundles option because it's useless with new bundles lifecycle. (if required, the same behaviour may be implemented with custom bundles lookup) Removed GuiceyOptions.BindConfigurationInterfaces option (interfaces are already bound with @Config qualifier) Guicey web installers ( WebInstallersBundle ) enabled by default. GuiceBundle.builder()#useWebInstallers() option removed Direct dropwizard bundles support: bundles could be registered directly in main bundle ( GuiceBundle.dropwizardBundles() ) or inside guicey bundle ( GuiceyBundle.dropwizardBundles() ). These bundles could be disabled (same as guicey bundles - with .disableDropwizardBundles() methods) and are show in reporting. Transitive dropwizard bundles tracking: all dropwizard bundles registered through guicey api are tracked for transitive registration with bootstrap proxy. That means that all transitive bundles are shown in reports and any transitive bundle could be disabled (with .disableDropwizardBundle or custom predicate). Also, deduplication checks will work (same as for guicey bundles and guice modules). Tracking may be disabled with GuieyOptions.TrackDropwizardBundles option. Allow registration of multiple instances for guice modules and guicey bundles (multiple instances of the same class) By default, equal instances of the same type considered duplicate (only one registered). So, to grant uniqueness of bundle or module, implement correct equals method. For custom cases (when custom equals method is impossible), DuplicateConfigDetector may be implemented and registered with GuiceBundle.Builder#duplicateConfigDetector() Legacy behaviour (1 instance per type) could be simulated with: .duplicateConfigDetector(new LegacyModeDuplicatesDetector()) OR method GuiceBundle.Builder#uniqueItems(Class...) may be used to specify exact items to grant uniqueness for ItemId is now used as identity instead of pure Class . ItemId compute object hash string and preserve it for instance identification. Class types does not contain hash in id. Required because even scopes, represented previously as classes now could be duplicated as multiple instances of the same bundle class could be registered. For simplicity, ItemId equals method consider class-only id's equal to any type instance id. Add bundle loops detection: as multiple bundle instances allowed loops are highly possible Entire bundle chain is provided in exception to simplify fixing loops. Add base classes for unique bundles and modules (with correct equals and hash code implementations): UniqueGuiceyBundle and UniqueModule or UniqueDropwizardAwareModule (use class name strings for comparison to correctly detect even instances of classes from different class loaders). Note: no such class for dropwizard bundle because it's useless (if you use guicey - use GuiceyBundle instead and if you need dropwizard bundle - it shouldn't be dependent on guicey classes) Support extensions recognition from guice modules (jersey1-guice style): extensions are detected from declaration in specified guice modules (essentially same as classpath scan, but from bindings) extensions declared in: direct type bindings (all generified or qualified declarations ignored) linked bindings (right part) bind(Something).to(Extension) are also recognized (which must also be non qualified) like in classpath scan @InvisibleForScanner prevents recognition (or bean may be simply qualified) all extension registration types may work together (classpath scan, manual declaration and binding declaration) extensions registered directly (or found by classpath scan) and also bound manually in guice module will not conflict anymore (as manual declaration would be detected) and so @LazyBinding workaround is not needed extensions declared in guice module may be also disabled (guicey will remove binding declaration in this case and all chains leading to this declartion to prevent possible context failures) Transitive gucie modules (installed by other modules) may be disabled with usual disableModules() (but only if guice bindings analysis is not disabled). enabled by default, but can be disabled with GuiceyOptions.AnalyzeModules option BindingInstaller interface changed (because of direct guice bindings): it now contains 3 methods for class binding, manual binding validation and reporting Extension classes loaded by different class loaders now detected as duplicate extension registration Guicey hooks, initially supposed to be used for testing only, now considered to be also used for diagnostic tools Add guicey hooks lookup from system property guicey.hooks as comma-separated list of classes. Add hook aliases support: alias name assumed to be used instead of full class name in system property ( -Dguicey.hooks ). Alias registered with GuiceBundle.builder()#hookAlias() . All registered aliases are logged at startup. Add diagnostic hook, which enables diagnostic reports and lifecycle logs. Could be enabled with system property: -Dguicey.hooks=diagnostic (where diagnostic is pre-registered hook alias) Useful to enable diagnostic logs on compiled (deployed) application. (breaking) Removed hooks recognition on registered GuiceyLifecycleLister (as it was very confusing feature) Add shared configuration state (for special configuration-time needs like bundles communication). This is required only in very special cases. But such unified place will replace all current and future hacks. Static access by application: SharedConfigurationState.get(app) or SharedConfigurationState.lookup(app, key) Static access by environment: SharedConfigurationState.get(env) or SharedConfigurationState.lookup(env, key) Value access from guicey bundle: boostrap.sharedState(key, defSupplier) , environment.sharedState(key) Value access from DropwizardAwareModule : sharedState Hooks can use GuiceBundle.Builder.withSharedState to access application state. (breaking) InjectorLookup now use global shared state clear() method removed, but SharedConfigurationState.clear() could be used instead (breaking) Test support changes Rename test extensions for guicey hooks registration: GuiceyConfigurationRule into GuiceyHooksRule @UseGuiceyConfiguration (spock extension) into @UseGuiceyHooks (breaking) Reporting changes All reports moved into one top-level debug package. All guicey reports are now guicey lifecycle listeners DiagnosticBundle bundle become ConfigurationDiagnostic guicey listener. Reporters are no more bound to guice context (they could always be constructed manually). DebugGuiceyLifecycle listener renamed into LifecycleDiagnostic Guicey reports (listeners) properly implement equals and hashcode in order to use new deduplicatation mechanism and avoid reports duplication (for example, if .printDiagnosticInfo() would be called multiple times, only one report would be shown; but still different configurations will be reported separately (e.g. list .printDiagnosticInfo() and .printAvailableInstallers() which internally use one listener)) Report all diagnostic reports as one log message in order to differentiate .printDiagnosticInfo() and .printAvailableInstallers() reports when both active Diagnostic report changes ( .printDiagnosticInfo() ): Show both dropwizard and guicey bundles together (dropwizard bundles marked with DW) Always show \"empty\" bundles (bundles without sub registrations) - important for dw bundles Add \"-\" before ignored or disabled items (to visually differentiate from accepted items) Identify instance deduplication: Instead of registrations count (REG(2)) show exact counter of all registered and accepted items: REG(5/12) Show ignored items even in context where items of the same type were accepted Show exact number of ignored items in context (DUPLICATE(3)) Show extension recognized from guice bindings (as sub report) Stats report improved: Show guice internal stat logs in stats diagnostic report (intercept guice logs) Show guicey time by phases (init/run/jersey) Show guice modules analysis stats Show installer marker interfaces in printAvailableInstallers() report to indicate installer actions (installation by type or instance, custom guice or jersey bindings, options support). Detailed lifecycle report ( .printLifecyclePhasesDetailed ) show context data for each event Add guice bindings report ( printGuiceBindings() or printAllGuiceBindings() ) Add guice aop appliance report ( .printGuiceAopMap() ). This report supposed to be used as \"a tool\" to look exact services and so configurable method version is directly available: .printGuiceAopMap(new GuiceAopConfig().types(...).methods(...)) Add web mappings report ( .printWebMappings() ): prints all registered servlets and filters Add jersey config report ( .printJerseyConfig ): prints all registered jersey extensions Fix configuration bindings for recursive configuration object declarations (#60) Guicey version added into BOM (dependencyManagement section in guicey pom) to avoid duplicate versions declarations Java 11 compatibility.

HK2 bridge must be enabled (GuiceyOptions.UseHkBridge) for HK2-first mode (exception thrown if not).

Basement for pluggable and extendable ui applications (like dashboards). EXPERIMENTAL MODULE Features: Use standard dropwizard modules: dropwizard-views and dropwizard-assets Support direct templates rendering (without rest resource declaration) Static resources, direct templates and dropwizard-views rest endpoints are handled under the same url (like everything is stored in the same directory - easy to link css, js and other resources) Multiple ui applications declaration with individual errors handling (error pages declaration like in servlet api, but not global) Ability to extend applications (much like good old resources copying above exploded war in tomcat) Problem \u00b6 Suppose you want to serve your ui to from the root url, then you need to re-map rest: server : rootPath : '/rest/*' applicationContextPath : / Static resources are in classpath: com/something/ index.html style.css Using dropwizard assets bundle to configure application: bootstrap . addBundle ( new AssetsBundle ( \"/com/something/\" , \"/\" , \"index.html\" )); Note that index.html could reference css with relative path: < link href = \"style.css\" rel = \"stylesheet\" > Now if we want to use template instead of pure html we configure dropwizard views: bootstrap . addBundle ( new ViewBundle < MyConfiguration > ()); Renaming index.html to index.ftl and add view resource: @Path ( \"/ui/\" ) @Produces ( MediaType . TEXT_HTML ) public class IndexResource { public static class IndexView extends View { public IndexView () { super ( \"/com/something/index.ftl\" ); } } @GET public IndexView get () { return new IndexView (); } } As a result, index page url become /rest/ui/ so we need to link css resource with full path ( /style.css ) instead of relative (or even re-configure server to back rest mapping to into root). It is already obvious that asset servlet and templates are not play well together. Solution \u00b6 The solution is obvious: make assets servlet as major resources supplier and with an additional filter to detect template requests and redirect rendering to actual rest. So example above should become: com/something/ index.ftl style.css Where index.ftl could use < link href = \"style.css\" rel = \"stylesheet\" > because it is queried by url /index.ftl : no difference with usual index.html - template rendering is hidden (and direct template file even don't need custom resource). When we need custom resource (most likely, for parameters mapping) we can still use it: @Path ( \"/views/ui/\" ) @Template ( \"foo.ftl\" ) @Produces ( MediaType . TEXT_HTML ) public class IndexResource { @GET @Path ( \"/foo/{id}\" ) public IndexView get ( @PathParam ( \"id\" ) String id ) { return new TemplateView (); } } It would be accessible from assets root /foo/12 (more on naming and mapping details below). Under the hood /foo/12 will be recognized as template call and redirected (server redirect) to /rest/ui/foo/12 . As you can see rest endpoints and templates are now \"a part\" of static resources.. just like good-old JSP (powered with rest mappings). And it is still pure dropwizard views. GSP implements per-application error pages support so each application could use it's own errors. In pure dropwizard-views such things should be implemented manually, which is not good for application incapsulation. Setup \u00b6 Avoid version in dependency declaration below if you use extensions BOM . Maven: <dependency> <groupId> ru.vyarus.guicey </groupId> <artifactId> guicey-server-pages </artifactId> <version> 5.1.0-2 </version> </dependency> Gradle: compile 'ru.vyarus.guicey:guicey-server-pages:5.1.0-2' See the most recent version in the badge above. Usage \u00b6 First of all, global GSP bundle must be installed in main application class. It configures and installs dropwizard-views (global). It supports the same configurations as pure dropwizard-views bundle. GuiceBundle . builder () . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . builder (). build ()); Remove direct dropwizard-views bundle registrations ( ViewBundle ) if it was already used in application. Template engines \u00b6 Out of the box dropwizard provides freemarker and mustache engines support. You will need to add dependency to one of them (or both) in order to activate it (or, maybe, some third party engine): implementation ( io.dropwizard:dropwizard-views-freemarker ) implementation ( io.dropwizard:dropwizard-views-mustache ) Other template engines available as 3 rd party modules. If your template engine is not yet supported then simply implement io.dropwizard.views.ViewRenderer in order to support it. ViewRenderer implementations are loaded automatically using ServiceLoader mechanism. If your renderer is not declared as service then simply add it directly: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . builder () . addViewRenderers ( new MyTempateSupport ()) . build ()); Duplicate renderers are automatically removed. List of detected template engines will be printed to console. You can get list of used renderers from bundle instance ServerPagesBundle#getRenderers() Note This is pure dropwizard-views staff (everything is totally standard). Configuration \u00b6 Views yaml configuration binding is the same as in dropwizard-views. views : freemarker : strict_syntax : true mustache : cache : false Where freemarker and mustache are keys from installed template renderer io.dropwizard.views.ViewRenderer#getConfigurationKey() . public class AppConfig extends Configuration { @JsonProperty private Map < String , Map < String , String >> views ; public Map < String , Map < String , String >> getViews () { return views ;} } . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . builder () . viewsConfiguration ( AppConfig :: getViews ) . build ()); If AppConfig#getViews return null then empty map will be used instead as config. Additionally, to direct yaml configuration binding, you can apply exact template engine modifications . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . builder () . viewsConfiguration ( AppConfig :: getViews ) . viewsConfigurationModifier ( \"freemarker\" , map -> map . put ( \"cache_storage\" , \"freemarker.cache.NullCacheStorage\" )) . build ()); Modifier always receive not null map (empty map is created automatically in global configuration). Multiple modifiers could be applied (even for the same section). Each GSP application could also apply modifiers (this is useful to tune defaults: e.g. in case of freemarker, application may need to apply default imports). The final configuration (after all modifiers) could be printed to console with .printViewsConfiguration() . Also, configuration is accessible from the bundle instance: ServerPagesBundle#getViewsConfig() . Applications \u00b6 Each GSP application is registered as separate bundle in main or admin context: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . app ( \"projectName-ui\" , \"com.app.ui\" , \"/\" ) . indexPage ( \"index.ftl\" ) . build ()) . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . adminApp ( \"projectName-admin\" , \"com.app.admin\" , \"/admin\" ) . build ()) Unlimited number of applications may be registered on each context. app ( \"projectName-ui\" , \"com.app.ui\" , \"/\" ) projectName-ui - unique(!) application name. Uniqueness is very important as name used for rest paths. To avoid collisions it's recommended to use domain-prefixed names to better identify application related resources. com.app.ui - classpath package with resources (application \"root\" folder; the same meaning as in dropwizard-assets); Also, it may be configured as /com/app/ui/ , but package notion is easier to understand / - application mapping url (in main or admin context; the same as in dropwizard-assets) (if context is prefixed ( server.applicationContextPath: /some or server.adminContextPath: /admin ) then GSP application will be available under this prefix) Warning It is a common desire to map ui on main context's root path ( / ), but, by default, dropwizard maps rest there and so you may see an error: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Multiple servlets map to path /*: app[mapped:JAVAX_API:null],io.dropwizard.jersey.setup.JerseyServletContainer-1280682[mapped:EMBEDDED:null] In this case simply re-map rest in yaml config: server : rootPath : '/rest/*' If application requires resources from multiple paths, use: ServerPagesBundle . app ( \"projectName-ui\" , \"com.app.path1\" , \"/\" ) . attachAssets ( \"com.app.path1\" ) ... For example, this can be useful to attach some shared resources. To attach webjars there is a pre-defined shortcut . You can even attach resources path for exact sub url: ServerPagesBundle . app ( \"projectName-ui\" , \"com.app.path1\" , \"/\" ) . attachAssets ( \"/sub/path/\" , \"com.app.path.sub\" ) ... And for urls starting from /sub/path/ application will look static resources (and templates) inside /com/app/path/sub/ first, and only after that under root paths. This way, you can map resources from different packages as you want. This is like if you copied everything from different packages into one place (like exploded war). Template engine constraint \u00b6 As GSP application declaration is separated from views configuration (GSP application may be even a 3 rd party bundle) then it must be able to check required template engines presence. For example, this application requires freemarker: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . app ( \"projectName-ui\" , \"com.app.ui\" , \"/\" ) . requireRenderers ( \"freemarker\" ) . build ()) Template engine name is declared in io.dropwizard.views.ViewRenderer#getConfigurationKey() (same name used in configuration). Templates support \u00b6 As dropwizard-views is used under the hood, all templates are always rendered with rest endpoints. All these rest endpoints are part of global rest. It is recommended to start all view rest with /view/ to make it clearly distinguishable from application rest. Also, rest views, related to one GSP application must also start with a common prefix: for example, /view/projectName/ui/.. . You need to map required rest prefix in GSP application: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . app ( \"projectName-ui\" , \"com.app.ui\" , \"/\" ) . mapViews ( \"/view/projectName/ui/\" ) This will \"map\" all view rest paths after prefix directly to GSP application root. So if you have view resource /view/projectName/ui/page1/action you can access it relatively to application mapping root (\"/\" in the example above) as /page1/action . By default, if views mapping is not declared manually, it would be set to application name ( /... -> /projectName-ui/... ) Under startup dropwizard logs all registered rest enpoints, so you can always see original rest mapping paths. For each registered GSP application list of \"visible\" paths will be logged as: INFO [2019-06-07 04:10:47,978] io.dropwizard.jersey.DropwizardResourceConfig: The following paths were found for the configured resources: GET /rest/views/projectName/ui/sample (com.project.ui.SampleViewResource) POST /rest/views/projectName/ui/other (com.project.ui.SampleViewResource) INFO [2019-06-07 04:10:47,982] ru.vyarus.guicey.gsp.app.ServerPagesApp: Server pages app 'com.project.ui' registered on uri '/*' in main context Static resources locations: com.app.ui Mapped handlers: GET /sample (com.project.ui.SampleViewResource #sample) POST /other (com.project.ui.SampleViewResource #other) Here you can see real rest mapping GET /rest/views/projectName/ui/sample and how it could be used relative to application path GET /sample . This report will always contain all correct view paths which must simplify overall understanding: if path not appear in the report - it's incorrectly mapped and when it's appear - always use the path from application report to access it. But that's not all: you can actually map other rest prefixed to sub urls: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . app ( \"projectName-ui\" , \"com.app.ui\" , \"/\" ) . mapViews ( \"/sub/path/\" , \"/view/projectName2/ui/something/\" ) This way, it is possible to combine rest endpoints, written for different applications (or simply prerare common view resource groups). Just note that in contrast to resources mapping, only one prefix may be mapped on each url! You will also need to map static resources location accordingly if you use relative template paths. Direct templates \u00b6 You can also render template files without declaring view rest at all (good old jsp way). If we call supported template type directly like http://localhost:8080/template.ftl it will be recognized as direct template call and rendered. Template file must be placed under registered classpath path root: /com/app/ui/template.ftl . Templates in sub folders will be rendered the same way, e.g. http://localhost:8080/sub/path/template.ftl will render /com/app/ui/sub/path/template.ftl . Template rest declaration \u00b6 Declaration differences with pure dropwizard-views: @Path value must start with mapped prefix (see the chapter above) Resource class must be annotated with @Template (even without exact template declaration) TemplateView must be used instead of dropwizard View as a base class for view models. Suppose we declaring page for gsp application .app(\"projectName-ui\", \"com.app.ui\", \"/\") As in pure views, in most cases we will need custom model object: public class SampleView extends TemplateView { private String name ; public SampleView ( String name ) { this . name = name ; } public String getName () { return this . name ; } } Note Custom model is optional - you can use TemplateView directly, as default \"empty\" model. @Path ( \"/views/projectName/ui/sample/\" ) @Template ( \"sample.ftl\" ) public class SamplePage { @Path ( \"{name}\" ) public SampleView doSomething ( @PathParam ( \"name\" ) String name ) { return new SampleView ( name ); } } And example template: <#-- @ftlvariable name=\"\" type=\"com.project.ui.SampleView\" --> <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> <title>Sample page</title> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"style.css\"> </head> <body> Name: ${name} </body> </html> After application startup, new url must appear in GSP application console report. If we call new page with http://localhost:8080/sample/fred we should see Name: fred as a result. Note Can pure dropwizard-views resources be used like that? Actually, yes, but they must be annotated with @Template because not annotated resources are not considered as potential GSP application views (and will not be shown in console report). @Template \u00b6 @Template annotation must be used on ALL template resources. It may declare default template for all methods in resource ( @Template(\"sample.ftl\") ) or be just a marker annotation ( @Template ). Annotation differentiate template resources from other api resources and lets you delare jersey extension only for template resources: @Provider @Template public class MyExtensions implements ContainerRequestFilter { ... } This request filter will be applied only to template resources. Such targeting is used internally in order to not affect global api with GSP specific handling logic. Template path resolution: If path starts with / then it would be resolved from classpath root Resolution relative to resource class Resolution relative to static resources location ( /com/app/ui/ in the example above) Examples: @Template(\"/com/project/custom/path/sample.ftl\") - absolute declaration. @Template(\"sub/sample.ftl\") - relative declaration @Template(\"../sub/sample.ftl\") - relative declaration Even if template is configured in the annotation, exact resource method could specify it's own template directly in TemplateView constructor: @Path ( \"/views/projectName/ui/sample/\" ) @Template ( \"sample.ftl\" ) // default template public class SamplePage { @Path ( \"/\" ) public TemplateView doSomething () { // override template return new TemplateView ( \"otherTemplate.ftl\" ); } } Template path resolution rules are the same as with annotation. TemplateContext \u00b6 TemplateContext contains all template contextual information. It could be accessed inside template with model's getContext() , e.g.: <#-- @ftlvariable name=\"\" type=\"com.project.ui.SampleView\" --> <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> <title>Sample page</title> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"style.css\"> </head> <body> Current url: ${context.url} </body> </html> In rest view resources it could be accessed with a static lookup: TemplateContext.getInstance() . This way you can always know current gsp application name, original url (before redirection to rest), root application mapping prefix and get original request object (which may be required for error pages). Index page \u00b6 Index page is a page shown for root application url ( / ). It could be declared as: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . app ( \"com.project.ui\" , \"/com/app/ui/\" , \"/\" ) . indexPage ( ' index . html ' ) . build ()) It could be: * Direct resource: index.html * Direct template: index.ftl * Rest powered template: /mapping/ Note By default, index page is set to \"\" because most likely your index page will be handled with rest and \"\" will redirect to root path (for current application): /com.project.ui/ Error pages \u00b6 Each GSP application could declare its own error pages (very similar to servlet api). It could be one global error page and different pages per status: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . app ( \"com.project.ui\" , \"/com/app/ui/\" , \"/\" ) . errorPage ( ' error . html ' ) . errorPage ( 500 , ' 500. html ' ) . errorPage ( 401 , ' 401. html ' ) . build ()) As with index pages, error page may be direct static html, direct template or rest path. Important Error pages are shown ONLY if requested type was text/html and pass error as is in other cases. Simply because it is not correct to return html when client was expecting different type. Errors handling logic detects: Static resources errors (404) Exceptions during view resource processing (including rendering errors) Direct error codes return without exception ( Resounce.status(404).build() ) Error pages may use special view class (or extend it) ErrorTemplateView which collects additional error-related info. For example, even direct error template could show: <#-- @ftlvariable name=\"\" type=\"ru.vyarus.guicey.gsp.views.template.ErrorTemplateView\" --> <h3>Url ${erroredUrl} failed to render with ${errorCode} status code</h3> <div>Error: ${error.class.simpleName}</div> <pre> ${errorTrace} </pre> For rest-powered error page: @Path ( \"/views/projectName/ui/error/\" ) @Template ( \"error.ftl\" ) public class ErrorPage { @Path ( \"/\" ) public TemplateView render () { // it may be any extending class if additional properties are required (the same as usual) ErrorTemplateView view = new ErrorTemplateView (); WebApplicationException ex = view . getError (); // analyze error return view ; } } (this error page can be mapped as .errorPage(\"/error/\") ). view.getError() always return WebApplicationException so use ex.geCause() to get original exception. But there will not always be useful exception because direct exception is only one of error cases (see above). In order to differentiate useful exceptions, you can check: if ( ex instanceof TracelessException ) { // only status code availbale int status = (( TracelessException ) ex ). getStatus (); } else { // actually throwed exception to analyze Throwable actualCause = ex . getCause () } TracelessException may be either AssertError for static resource fail or TemplateRestCodeError for direct non 200 response code in rest. Important GSP errors handling override ExceptionMapper and views errors mechanisms because it intercept exceptions before them (using RequestEventListener )! So your ExceptionMapper will be called, but user will still see GSP error page. The motivation is simple: otherwise it would be very hard to write side effect free GSP applications because template resources exceptions could be intercepted with ExceptionMapper 's declared in dropwizard application. To overcome this limitation, you can disable errors handling with @ManuaErrorHandling . It may be applied on resource method or to resource class (to disable on all methods). For example: @Path ( \"/com.project.ui/error/\" ) @Template ( \"page.ftl\" ) public class ErrorPage { @ManualErrorHandling @Path ( \"/\" ) public TemplateView render () { // if exception appear inside this method, it would be handled with ExceptionMapper // GSP error page will not be used // Also, if method return non 200 error code (>=400) like // return Response.status(500).build() // it would be also not handled with GSP error mechanism (only pure dropwizard staff) } } Note that disabled errors will be indicated as [DISABLED ERRORS] in console report. SPA routing \u00b6 If you use Single Page Applications then you may face the need to recognize html5 client routing urls and redirect to index page. You can read more about it in guicey SPA module . As guicey SPA module can't be used directly with GSP, it's abilities is integrated directly and could be activated with: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . app ( \"projectName-ui\" , \"com.app.ui\" , \"/\" ) . spaRouting () . build ()) Or, if custom detection regex is required: .spaRouting(customRegex) Most likely, usage use-case would be: index page requires some server-size templating. Template requests detection \u00b6 GSP must differentiate static resource calls from template calls. It assumes that static resources would always end with an extension (e.g. /something/some.ext ) and so: If request without extension - it's a template If extension is recognized as template extension - render as template Other cases are static resources The following regular expression used for extension detection: (?:^|/)([^/]+\\.(?:[a-zA-Z\\d]+))(?:\\?.+)?$ If it does not cover you specific cases, it could be changed using: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . app ( \"com.project.ui\" , \"/com/app/ui/\" , \"/\" ) . filePattern ( \"(?:^|/)([^/]+\\\\.(?:[a-zA-Z\\\\d]+))(?:\\\\?.+)?$\" ) . build ()) In case when you have static files without extension, you can include them directly into detection regexp (using regex or (|) syntax). Pattern must return detected file name as first matched group (so direct template could be detected). Pattern is searched (find) inside path, not matched (so simple patterns will also work). Extending applications \u00b6 In \"war world\" there is a a very handy thing as overlays: when we can apply our resources \"above\" existing war. This way we can replace existing files (hack & tune) and add our own files so they would live inside app as they were always be there. In order to achieve similar goals there is a application extension mechanism. For example we application: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . app ( \"projectName-ui\" , \"com.app.ui\" , \"/\" ) . build ()) With multiple pages inside: /com/app/ui/ page1.ftl page2.ftl style.css Each page could include style relatively as style.css . Most likely, there will even be master template (freemarker) which unifies styles and common script installation. This application is distributed as 3 rd party bundle (jar). If we need to add one more page to this application in our current dropwizard application, we can: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . extendApp ( \"projectName-ui\" ) . attachAssets ( \"com.otherApp.ui.ext\" ) . build ()) And put another page into classpath: /com/otherApp/ui/ext/ page3.ftl This page could also reference style.css relatively, the same as pages in the main application. On application startup, you will notice new resources location: Static resources locations: /com/app/ui/ /com/otherApp/ui/ext/ Now both locations are \"roots\" for the application. The same way as if we copied /com/otherApp/ui/ext/ into /com/app/ui/ . http://localhost:8080/page3.ftl would correctly render new page. There may be unlimited number of application extensions. If extended application is not available, it is not considered as an error: it's assumed as optional application extension, which will be activated if some 3 rd party jar with GSP application appear in classpath. You can also map addition rest prefixes: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . extendApp ( \"projectName-ui\" ) . mapViews ( \"/sub/folder/\" , \"/views/something/ext/\" ) . build ()) In some cases, extensions may depend on dropwizard configuration, but bundles created under initialization phase. To workaround this you can use delayed extensions init: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . extendApp ( \"projectName-ui\" ) . delayedConfiguration (( env , assets , views ) -> { if ( env . configuration (). isExtensionsEnabled ()) { assets . attach ( \"com.foo.bar\" ) } }) . build ()) Webjars usage \u00b6 If you want to use resources from webjars in GSP application: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . app ( \"com.project.ui\" , \"/com/app/ui/\" , \"/\" ) . attachWebjars () . build ()) For example, to add jquery: implementation 'org.webjars.npm:jquery:3.4.1' And it could be referenced as: < script src = \"jquery/3.4.1/dist/jquery.min.js\" /> Under the hood .attachWebjars() use extensions mechanism and adds META-INF/resources/webjars/ as application resources path: ServerPagesBundle . app ( \"com.project.ui\" , \"/com/app/ui/\" , \"/\" ) ... . attachAssets ( \"META-INF/resources/webjars/\" ) OR . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . extendApp ( \"app name\" ) . attachAssets ( \"META-INF/resources/webjars/\" ) . build ()) Tip You can always see the content of webjar on webjars site by clicking on package \"Files\" column. Use everything after \"META-INF/resources/webjars/\" to reference file. Custom classloaders \u00b6 Very specific case There is a limited support for custom classloaders. Assumed case is when application resources could be loaded with different class loaders. Custom classloader could be specified during application registration, for example: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . app ( \"com.project.ui\" , \"/com/app/ui/\" , \"/\" , classLoader ) . build ()) The same for admin app and extension. Warning This will affect only static resources! Template engine will not be able to resolve resources because it is not aware of custom loaders. Info The main problem here is dropwizards View class which accepts only file path (String), so even if correct URL object is known (which is enough to load resource) before view construction it can't be used further. To workaround this, resolved absolute template path passed to view constructor. GSP module is able to found correct resourse later in correct class loader, but it requires obvious changes to template engine templates resolution mechanism. To resolve this, special templates resolver is required. For freemarker it is provided out of the box, but must be enabled on main bundle: ServerPagesBundle . builder () . enableFreemarkerCustomClassLoadersSupport () ... For mustache module it is impossible to write such integration.","title":"Server Pages"},{"location":"extras/gsp/#guicey-server-pages","text":"Extensions project module Brings the simplicity of JSP to dropwizard-views.

TEXT_HTML ) public class IndexResource { public static class IndexView extends View { public IndexView () { super ( \"/com/something/index.ftl\" ); } } @GET public IndexView get () { return new IndexView (); } } As a result, index page url become /rest/ui/ so we need to link css resource with full path ( /style.css ) instead of relative (or even re-configure server to back rest mapping to into root).

TEXT_HTML ) public class IndexResource { @GET @Path ( \"/foo/{id}\" ) public IndexView get ( @PathParam ( \"id\" ) String id ) { return new TemplateView (); } } It would be accessible from assets root /foo/12 (more on naming and mapping details below). Under the hood /foo/12 will be recognized as template call and redirected (server redirect) to /rest/ui/foo/12 . As you can see rest endpoints and templates are now \"a part\" of static resources.. just like good-old JSP (powered with rest mappings). And it is still pure dropwizard views.

You need to map required rest prefix in GSP application: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . app ( \"projectName-ui\" , \"com.app.ui\" , \"/\" ) . mapViews ( \"/view/projectName/ui/\" ) This will \"map\" all view rest paths after prefix directly to GSP application root.

For example: @Path ( \"/com.project.ui/error/\" ) @Template ( \"page.ftl\" ) public class ErrorPage { @ManualErrorHandling @Path ( \"/\" ) public TemplateView render () { // if exception appear inside this method, it would be handled with ExceptionMapper // GSP error page will not be used // Also, if method return non 200 error code (>=400) like // return Response.status(500).build() // it would be also not handled with GSP error mechanism (only pure dropwizard staff) } } Note that disabled errors will be indicated as [DISABLED ERRORS] in console report.","title":"Error pages"},{"location":"extras/gsp/#spa-routing","text":"If you use Single Page Applications then you may face the need to recognize html5 client routing urls and redirect to index page.

This way we can replace existing files (hack & tune) and add our own files so they would live inside app as they were always be there. In order to achieve similar goals there is a application extension mechanism. For example we application: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . app ( \"projectName-ui\" , \"com.app.ui\" , \"/\" ) . build ()) With multiple pages inside: /com/app/ui/ page1.ftl page2.ftl style.css Each page could include style relatively as style.css . Most likely, there will even be master template (freemarker) which unifies styles and common script installation. This application is distributed as 3 rd party bundle (jar). If we need to add one more page to this application in our current dropwizard application, we can: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . extendApp ( \"projectName-ui\" ) . attachAssets ( \"com.otherApp.ui.ext\" ) . build ()) And put another page into classpath: /com/otherApp/ui/ext/ page3.ftl This page could also reference style.css relatively, the same as pages in the main application. On application startup, you will notice new resources location: Static resources locations: /com/app/ui/ /com/otherApp/ui/ext/ Now both locations are \"roots\" for the application. The same way as if we copied /com/otherApp/ui/ext/ into /com/app/ui/ . http://localhost:8080/page3.ftl would correctly render new page. There may be unlimited number of application extensions. If extended application is not available, it is not considered as an error: it's assumed as optional application extension, which will be activated if some 3 rd party jar with GSP application appear in classpath. You can also map addition rest prefixes: . bundles ( ServerPagesBundle . extendApp ( \"projectName-ui\" ) . mapViews ( \"/sub/folder/\" , \"/views/something/ext/\" ) . build ()) In some cases, extensions may depend on dropwizard configuration, but bundles created under initialization phase.

Integration removes these restrictions: dao (repository) objects are normal guice beans and transaction scope is controlled by @InTransaction annotation (note that such name was intentional to avoid confusion with JDBI own's Transaction annotation and more common Transactional annotations). At the beginning of unit of work, JDBI handle is created and bound to thread (thread local).

There are many existing dropwizard bundles and it would be insance to get rid of them. It is just not possible to register guice modules and use many guicey features from dropwizard bundles. Guicey and dropwizard bundles share the same lifecycle : public interface ConfiguredBundle < T > { default void initialize ( Bootstrap <?> bootstrap ) {} default void run ( T configuration , Environment environment ) throws Exception {} } public interface GuiceyBundle { default void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) {} default void run ( GuiceyEnvironment environment ) throws Exception {} } Guicey bundles is an extension to dropwizard bundles (without restrictions), so it is extremely simple to switch from dropwizard bundles.

Example guicey bundle: public class MyFeatureBundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { bootstrap . installers ( MyFeatureExtensionInstaller . class ) // dropwizard bundle usage . dropwizardBundle ( new RequiredDwBundle ()) . modules ( new MyFeatureModule ()); // dropwizard bootstrap access bootstrap . bootstrap (). addCommand ( new MyFeatureCommand ()); } @Override public void run ( GuiceyEnvironment environment ) throws Exception { // configuration access environment . modules ( new SpecialModle ( environment . configuration (). getSomeValue ())) . onApplicationStartup (() -> logger . info ( \"Application started!\" )); // dropwizard environment access environment . environment (). setValidator ( new MyCustomValudatior ()); } } bootstrap . addBundle ( GuiceBundle . builder () . bundles ( new MyFeatureBundle ()) . build () ); Example bundles could by found in guicey itself: CoreInstallersBundle - all default installers WebInstallersBundle - servlet and filter annotations support HK2DebugBundle - guice - HK2 scope debug tool Even more examples are in extensions modules Configuration \u00b6 See all bundle configuration options Note Almost all configurations appear under initialization phase only. This was done in order to follow dropwizard conventions (all configuration under init and all initialization under run). The only exception is guice modules: it is allowed to register modules in both phases. Modules are often require direct configuration values and without this exception it would be too often required to create wrapper guicey-aware modules for proper registration. Besides, in dropwizard itself HK2 modules could only be registered in run phase. De-duplication \u00b6 Your bundle may be installed multiple times and you must always think what is expected behaviour in this case. For example: . bundles ( new MyBundle (), new MuBundle ()) Bundles are often intended to be used multiple times (for example, spa bundle ). But in some cases, only one bundle instance must be installed. For example, eventbus bundle must be installed just once. Or it may be some common bundle, installed by multiple other bundles. In order to solve such cases guicey provides de-duplication mechanism . So when you need to avoid redundant bundle instances, you can: extend UniqueGuiceyBundle to allow only one bundle instance implement equals method (where you can implement any deduplication rules (e.g. based on bundles constructor arguments)) Note Deduplication could also help in case when your bundle is available through lookup with default configuration, but could be registered with customized configuration. In this case, you can also use UniqueGuiceyBundle : manually registered bundle will always be registered first, and bundle obtained with lookup mechansm would be considered as duplicate and not used (for example, eventbus bundle use this) Bundle lookup \u00b6 Bundle lookup mechanism used to lookup guicey bundles in various sources. It may be used to activate specific bundles in tests (e.g. HK2 scope control bundle ) or to install 3 rd party extensions from classpath. Bundle lookup is equivalent to registering bundle directly using builder bundles method. Note Bundles from lookup will always be registered after all manually registered bundles so you can use de-cuplication to accept manual instance and deny lookup. By default, two lookup mechanisms active: by property and with service loader . All found bundles are logged into console: INFO [2019-10-17 14:50:14,304] ru.vyarus.dropwizard.guice.bundle.DefaultBundleLookup: guicey bundles lookup = ru.vyarus.dropwizard.guice.diagnostic.support.bundle.LookupBundle You can disable default lookups with: bootstrap . addBundle ( GuiceBundle . builder () . disableBundleLookup () . build () System property lookup \u00b6 System property guicey.bundles could contain comma separated list of guicey bundle classes. These bundles must have no-args constructor. For example, activate HK2 debug bundle for tests: java ... -Dguicey.bundles=ru.vyarus.dropwizard.guice.module.jersey.debug.HK2DebugBundle Alternatively, system property may be set in code: PropertyBundleLookup . enableBundles ( HK2DebugBundle . class ) Service loader lookup \u00b6 Using default java ServiceLoader mechanism, loads all GuiceyBundle services. This is useful for automatically install 3 rd party extensions (additional installers, extensions, guice modules). Note This could be used to install bundle with default configuration: with proper de-duplication if user register custom bundle version, it will be used and bundle from lookup will be ignored. For example, eventbus bundle works like this 3 rd party jar must contain services file: META-INF/services/ru.vyarus.dropwizard.guice.module.installer.bundle.GuiceyBundle File contain one or more (per line) GuiceyBundle implementations. E.g. com.foo.Bundle1 com.foo.Bundle2 Then Bundle1, Bundle2 would be loaded automatically on startup (would appear in logs). Customizing lookup mechanism \u00b6 Custom bundle lookup must implement GuiceyBundleLookup interface: public class CustomBundleLookup implements GuiceyBundleLookup { @Override public List < GuiceyBundle > lookup () { List < GuiceyBundle > bundles = Lists . newArrayList (); ... return bundles ; } } Custom lookup implementation may be registered through: bootstrap . addBundle ( GuiceBundle . builder () . bundleLookup ( new CustomBundleLookup ()) . build () But it's better to register it through default implementation DefaultBundleLookup , which performs composition of multiple lookup implementations and logs resolved bundles to console. bootstrap . addBundle ( GuiceBundle . builder () . bundleLookup ( new DefaultBundleLookup (). addLookup ( new CustomBundleLookup ())) . build () To override list of default lookups: bootstrap . addBundle ( GuiceBundle . builder () . bundleLookup ( new DefaultBundleLookup ( new ServiceLoaderBundleLookup (), new CustomBundleLookup ())) . build () Here two lookup mechanisms registered (property lookup is not registered and will not be implicitly added). Dropwizard bundles \u00b6 Dropwizard bundles can be used as before: be registered directly in Bootstrap . Guicey provides direct api for dropwizard bundles registration: GuiceBundle . builder () . dropwizardBundles ( new MyDwBundle ()) and in bundles: public class MyBundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { bootstrap . dropwizardBundle ( new MyDwBundle ()); } } Note The most common case is: extending some existing 3 rd party integration (dropwizard bundle) with guice bindings (or adding guicey installers for simplified usage). public class XIntegratuionBundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { bootstrap . dropwizardBundle ( new DropwizardXBundle ()); . modules ( new XBindingsModule ()) } } JDBI bundle could be king of such example: it does not use dropwizard bundle, but it defines additional extension types to simplify configuration. When you register dropwizard bundles through guicey api: Bundle (and all transitive bundles) appear in report Bundle itself or any transitive bundle could be disabled De-duplication mechanism will work for bundle and it's transitive bundles So, for example, if you have \"common bundle\" problem (when 2 bundles register some common bundle and so you can use these bundles together) it could be solved just by registering bundle throug guicey api (and proper configuration ) Transitive bundles tracking \u00b6 Transitive dropwizard bundles are tracked with a Bootstrap object proxy (so guicey could intercept addBundle call). If you have problems with it, you can switch off transitive bundles tracking: . option ( GuiceyOptions . TrackDropwizardBundles , false ) If you don't want to switch off tracking, but still have problems registering some bundle, you can always register it directly in bootstrap object: public class MyBundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { bootstrap . bootstrap (). addBundle ( new MyDwBundle ()); } } bootstrap.bootstrap() - is a raw bootstrap (not a proxy).","title":"Bundles"},{"location":"guide/bundles/#guicey-bundles","text":"By analogy with dropwizard bundles, guicey has it's own GuiceyBundle . These bundles contains almost the same options as main GuiceBundle builder . The main purpose is the same as dropwizard bundles: incapsulate logic by grouping installers, extensions and guice modules related to specific feature. Note Guicey bundles are assumed to be used instead of dropwizard bundles in guicey-powered application. It does not mean that drowpizard bundles can't be used - of course they can! There are many existing dropwizard bundles and it would be insance to get rid of them. It is just not possible to register guice modules and use many guicey features from dropwizard bundles.

Configuration items \u00b6 . enableAutoConfig ( String ... basePackages ) Enable classpath scan for automatic extensions registration, custom installers search and commands search (if enabled) . modules ( Module ... modules ) Guice modules registration Here guice modules are created in initialization phase, when Configuration and Environment are not yet available. If they are required for module either use \"Aware\" interfaces or register module in GuiceyBundle's run method (under run phase). . modulesOverride ( Module ... modules ) Overriding registered guice modules bindings (using guice Modules.override() api) Extensions are not recognized in overriding modules (intentionally)! . installers ( Class <? extends FeatureInstaller > ... installers ) Guicey extension installers registration. Required if you have custom installers or to specify installers after disabling all default installers: . noDefaultInstallers () Custom installers are registered automatically when classpath scan is enabled. . extensions ( Class <?> ... extensionClasses ) Manual extensions registration. May be used together with classpath scan and binding extensions . extensionsOptional ( Class <?> ... extensionClasses ) Optional extensions registration. The difference with .extensions is that such extensions will be automatically disabled if there are no compatible installers (instead of throwing exception). . bundles ( GuiceyBundle ... bundles ) Guicey bundles registration. . bundleLookup ( GuiceyBundleLookup bundleLookup ) Custom lookup mechanism for guicey bundles. By default, lookup by system property and ServiceLoader are enabled. To disable all lookups use: . disableBundleLookup () . dropwizardBundles ( ConfiguredBundle ... bundles ) Shortcut for dropwizard bundles registration. This way guicey could apply disable and de-duplication rules to registered bundles (and, also, registered bundles appear in reports ) . searchCommands () Search and register custom dropwizard commands. Requires enabled classpath scan Disable items \u00b6 Registered configuration items could be disabled . This is mostly useful for tests where entire application parts could be disabled and replaced (e.g. with mocks) this way. Could be also useful to \"hack\" third party items. . disableInstallers ( Class <? extends FeatureInstaller > ... installers ) . disableExtensions ( Class <?> ... extensions ) . disableModules ( Class <? extends Module > ... modules ) Affects transitive guice modules . disableBundles ( Class <? extends GuiceyBundle > ... bundles ) . disableDropwizardBundles ( Class <? extends ConfiguredBundle > ... bundles ) Affects only dropwizard bundles registered through guicey api and their transitive bundles . disable ( Predicate < ItemInfo > ... predicates ) Custom disable predicate useful to disable groups of items (by some sign) Items de-duplication \u00b6 Guiey detects instances of the same type (bundles, modules). By default, two instances considered as duplicates if they are equal, so duplicates could be controlled with proper equals method implementation. When it's not possible, custom de-duplication implementation could be used. Tip Special base classes are available with correct equals implementations: UniqueModule (for guice modules) and UniqueGuiceyBundle (for bundles). . duplicateConfigDetector ( DuplicateConfigDetector detector ) Special implementation provided to replicate legacy guicey behaviour \"one instance per class\": duplicateConfigDetector ( new LegacyModeDuplicatesDetector ()) . uniqueItems ( Class <?> ... configurationItems ) Register special de-duplication implementation which will allow only one instance of provided types. Options \u00b6 Guicey generic options mechanism may be used for guicey (or other 3 rd party bundles) fine-tuning. Guicey option enums: GuiceyOptions and InstallersOptions . option ( K option , Object value ) Set option value (override default) . options ( Map < Enum , Object > options ) Set multiple options at once (e.g. map system properties as option values) GuiceyOptions \u00b6 Note Some options are configured through main bundle shortcut methods and so they are not shown in the table below. Option Type Default Description BindConfigurationByPath Boolean true Introspect configuration to be able to bind separate values TrackDropwizardBundles Boolean true Recognize transitive dropwizard bundles (for bundles registered through guicey api) AnalyzeGuiceModules Boolean true Extension recognition in guice bindings, transitive modules disable support GuiceFilterRegistration EnumSet<DispatcherType> [REQUEST] Guice filter registration options UseHkBridge Boolean false Activates HK2-guice bridge (bridge dependency must be avaiable in classpath) InstallersOptions \u00b6 Option Type Default Description DenyServletRegistrationWithClash Boolean false Throw error if @WebServlet annotated servlets clash with already registered servlets DenySessionListenersWithoutSession Boolean false Throw error for registered SessionListener (annotated @WebListener ) if sessions support not enabled (default) ForceSingletonForJerseyExtensions Boolean true Force singleton scope for registered jersey extensions (resources, exception handlers etc) if no explicit scope declared Injector \u00b6 . injectorFactory ( InjectorFactory injectorFactory ) Use custom injector factory implementation. May be useful for tests or for integration of 3 rd paty library (like governator ) . build ( Stage stage ) Build bundle with custom guice stage (by default, Production ) . build () Build bundle with default guice stage Lifecycle \u00b6 . listen ( GuiceyLifecycleListener ... listeners ) Listen for guicey lifecycle events . noGuiceFilter () This will remove guice request and session scopes and also it would become impossible to use ServletModule s . strictScopeControl () Bean target container is defined with @JerseyManaged and @GuiceManaged annotations or default (either guice or hk2 used as default (for jersey extensions)) . useHK2ForJerseyExtensions () Beans managed by HK2 can't use guice AOP, so AOP-based features will not work with such beans Danger In the next version guicey will get rid of HK2 and so all HK2 related options will be removed (only guice will be used). Also, .noGuiceFilter() will be removed because request scope will be required. Diagnostic tools \u00b6 Guicey provide many bundled console reports to help with problems diagnostic (or to simply clarify how application works) during development, like: . printDiagnosticInfo () See diagnostic section for a full list of available reports. Hooks-related \u00b6 . hookAlias ( String name , Class <? extends GuiceyConfigurationHook > hook ) Hook alias registration for simplified usage (various diagnostic tools quick enabling with a system property) . withSharedState ( Consumer < SharedConfigurationState > stateAction ) This method is mainly useful for hooks, because it's the only way to access application shared state from hook . Guicey bundle \u00b6 GuiceyBundle s are like dropwizard bundles, but with greater abilities . Supposed to be used instead of dropwizard bundles. Bundles are registered either directly (in main bundle or other guicey bundle) or resolved by bundles lookup. Initialization \u00b6 public class MyBundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { ... } } Bundle initialization share many methods in common with main guice bundle : . modules ( Module ... modules ) . modulesOverride ( Module ... modules ) . installers ( Class <? extends FeatureInstaller > ... installers ) . extensions ( Class <?> ... extensionClasses ) . extensionsOptional ( Class <?> ... extensionClasses ) . bundles ( GuiceyBundle ... bundles ) . dropwizardBundles ( ConfiguredBundle ... bundles ) . disableInstallers ( Class <? extends FeatureInstaller > ... installers ) . disableExtensions ( Class <?> ... extensions ) . disableModules ( Class <? extends Module > ... modules ) No disable for bundles because at this moment some bundles were already executed and so real state could be inconsistent with configuration (and highly depend on processing order). . listen ( GuiceyLifecycleListener ... listeners ) Listener registered in bundle will \"hear\" only events starting with GuiceyLifecycle#BundlesInitialized Shortcuts: . bootstrap () . application () Option value access: . option ( T option ) Bundle can't declare option value because it would make options state not predictable (highly dependent on initialization order) Shared state access: . shareState ( Class <?> key , Object value ) Declare shared state ( primary module scenario) . sharedState ( Class <?> key , Supplier < T > defaultValue ) Get or init shared state ( equal bundles scenario) . sharedStateOrFail ( Class <?> key , String message , Object ... args ) Shortcut to get shared state or immediately fail if not declared Run \u00b6 public class MyBundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void run ( GuiceyEnvironment environment ) { ... } } Everything is configured under initialization phase.

For example: . modules ( new MyModule ( \"one\" ), new MyModule ( \"two\" )) Note Before, guice did not allow to register multiple modules of the same type, but multiple instances support is more logical in context of dropwizard, because dropwizard itself allows registration of multiple bundles of the same type. Duplicates \u00b6 But in some cases it is desirable to avoid such registrations. For example, if two bundles install the same common bundle it would be installed twice: public class Feature1Bundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { bootstrap . bundles ( new CommonBundle ); } } public class Feature2Bundle implements GuiceyBundle { @Override public void initialize ( GuiceyBootstrap bootstrap ) { bootstrap . bundles ( new CommonBundle ); } } GuiceBundle . buider () . bundles ( new Feature1Bundle (). new Feature2Bundle ()) ... To workaround such cases deduplication mechanism* was introduced: instances of the same type are considered duplicate if they are equal. Equals method \u00b6 In order to resolve \"common bundle/module problem\" bundle/module must only properly implement equals method: public class CommonBundle implements GuiceyBundle { ... @Override public boolean equals ( final Object obj ) { return obj != null && getClass (). equals ( obj . getClass ()); } } Tip Guicey provide base classes for such cases: UniqueGuiceyBundle for unique bundles and UniqueModule (or UniqueDropwizardAwareModule ) for unique guice modules. So bundle above could be simplified to: public class CommonBundle extends UniqueGuiceyBundle { ... } Equals logic could be more complicated: for example, it may involve constructor parameters comparison to treat as duplicates only instances with the same parameters. Unique items \u00b6 When it is impossible to properly implement equals method (for example, because target bundle or module is 3 rd party) you can simply explicitly declare them as unique: GuiceBundle . builder () . uniqueItems ( Some3rdPartyBundle . class , Some3rdPartyModule . class ) Now only one instance of Some3rdPartyBundle and Some3rdPartyModule will be registered and all other instances considered as duplicate. General unique logic \u00b6 .uniqueItems() method above is actually a shortcut for custom deduplication mechanism registration (most common case). But you can implement your own deduplication logic and register with: GuiceBundle . builder () ... . duplicateConfigDetector (( List < Object > registered , Object newItem ) -> { if ( newItem isntanceof Some3rdPartyBundle ) { // decide if item collide with provided registered instances (of the same type) return detectedDuplicate // instance that registered is duplicate to or null to accept item } // allow instance registration return null ; }) Important This does not override equals method logic: custom de-duplication mechanism is called only after equals check. Warning You can't use .duplicateConfigDetector() and .uniqueItems() at the same time - one would override another (depends on order). In case of override you will only see warning in logs. Legacy mode \u00b6 Old guicey \"1 instance per class\" behaviour could be recovered with bundled detector: . duplicateConfigDetector ( new LegacyModeDuplicatesDetector ()) Reporting \u00b6 Configuration diagnostic report ( .printDiagnosticInfo() ) shows all registered instances and ignored duplicates. For example, if we have module declared to be unique by constructor value: public class VMod extends AbstractModule { private int value ; public VMod ( int value ) { this . value = value ; } @Override public boolean equals ( Object obj ) { return obj instanceof VMod && value . equals ( obj . value ); } } If modules are registered like this: GuiceBundle . builder () . modules ( new VMod ( 1 ), new VMod ( 1 ), new VMod ( 2 ), new VMod ( 2 )) . printDiagnosticInfo () . build () Report would contain: GUICE MODULES = VMod (com.mycompany) *REG(2/4) APPLICATION \u251c\u2500\u2500 module VMod (com.mycompany) \u251c\u2500\u2500 module -VMod (com.mycompany) *DUPLICATE \u251c\u2500\u2500 module VMod#2 (com.mycompany) \u251c\u2500\u2500 module -VMod#2 (com.mycompany) *DUPLICATE Where you can see that 2 of 4 registered modules of type VMod were registered. Note that instances are numbered (#2) in order of registration (without duplicates) so you can always see what bundle were considered as original (and see registration order when bundles of the same type are registered in different bundles). Limitations \u00b6 Guice modules \u00b6 Transitive guice modules are not counted during de-duplication. For example, public class MyModule extends AbstractModule {} public class SomeModule extends AbstractModule { @Override public void configure () { // transitive module install ( new MyModule ()); } } GuiceBindle . builder () . modules ( new OtherModule (), new MyModule ()) . uniqueItems ( MyModule . class ) This will not work because guicey is not aware of transitive modules (guicey can only know modules tree on class level, but can't see exact instances). BUT guice natively support de-duplication of equal modules , so if your module have proper equals public class MyModule extends UniqueModule {} Then guice will perform de-duplication itself. Warning Guice will perform de-deplication itself only if both equals and hashCode properly implemented (like in UniqueModule ) Note Guice can also de-duplicate bindings : if bindings from different module instances are the same then guice will simply ignore duplicate bindings. Dropwizard bundles \u00b6 Guicey can see transitive dropwizard bundles and properly apply de-duplication logic. For example, public class MyBundle implements ConfiguredBundle {} public class OtherBundle implements ConfiguredBundle { @Override public void initialize ( Bootstrap bootstrap ) { // transitive bundle bootstrap . addBundle ( new MyBundle ()); } } GuiceBindle . builder () . dropwizardBundles ( new OtherBundle (), new MyBundle ()) . uniqueItems ( MyBundle . class ) This will work because guicey use special proxy to intercept transitive registrations (so, essentially, transitive registrations are treated the same as direct) Note This means that if you have \"common dropwizard bundle\" problem, then you can simply register it with guicey and it will be able to properly de-duplicate it. BUT guicey does not \"see\" directly installed bundles (intentionally!).

Use installers report to see all available installers. How it works \u00b6 All registered manually extensions , classes from classpath scan and unqualified guice bindings are recognized by registered installers: public class FeatureInstaller { boolean matches ( Class <?> type ); } Detected extensions are bound to guice context either with default binder.bind(foundClass) or by installer itself (default binding is required to support guice .requireExplicitBindings() option). After injector creation, installers register extension in dropwizard (not necessary, but most often). For example, installation of extension instance (obtained from injector injector . getInstance ( foundClass ) ): public interface InstanceInstaller < T > { void install ( Environment environment , T instance ); } Jersey-related extensions are installed later, during jersey context startup: public interface JerseyInstaller < T > { void install ( AbstractBinder binder , Injector injector , Class < T > type ); } Installers are ordered . Each extension is installed by only one installer! If extension could be recognized by more then one installers, it will be installed only by first matching installer (according to installers order). Writing custom installer \u00b6 Just for example, suppose we have some scheduling framework and we want to detect extensions, implementing ScheduledTask class. First of all, installer must implement FeatureInstaller interface. Here extension detection must be implemented public class ScheduledInstaller implements FeatureInstaller { @Override public boolean matches ( final Class <?> type ) { return FeatureUtils . is ( type , ScheduledTask . class ); } // NOTE: report() method will describe later } Next, installer must register extension somehow. There may be different options: BindingInstaller allows custom guice bindings. If installer doesn't implement this interface simple bind(type) will be called to register in guice. TypeInstaller used for registration based on type (no instance created during installation). InstanceInstaller used for instance registration. Instance created using injector.getInstance(type) . JerseyInstaller used for registration of bindings in HK2 context. Note that extensions may use @LazyBinding annotation. In general case such extensions will not be registered in guice. In case of BindingInstaller , special hint will be passed and installer should decide how to handle it (may throw exception as not supported). BindingInstaller called in time of injector creation, whereas TypeInstaller and InstanceInstaller are called just after injector creation. JerseyInstaller is called on jersey start. Installers are not guice beans! So injections can't be used inside them. This is because installers also used during initialization phase and instantiated before injector creation. For example, our installer would register extension instance into some scheduler framework: public class ScheduledInstaller implements FeatureInstaller , InstanceInstaller < ScheduledTask > { ... @Override public void install ( Environment environment , ScheduledTask instance ) { SchedulerFramework . registerTask ( instance ); } } Tip TypeInstaller and InstanceInstaller could access injector with InjectorLookup . getInjector ( environment ). get (); And shared state : SharedConfigurationState . get ( environment ). get (); The last remaining part is reporting - we must see all installed beans in console: public class ScheduledInstaller implements FeatureInstaller , InstanceInstaller < ScheduledTask > { private final Reporter reporter = new Reporter ( ScheduledInstaller . class , \"scheduled tasks =\" ); ... @Override public void install ( Environment environment , ScheduledTask instance ) { SchedulerFramework . registerTask ( instance ); // register for reporting reporter . line ( \"(%s)\" , FeatureUtils . getInstanceClass ( instance ). getName ()); } @Override public void report () { reporter . report (); } } Report method will be called automatically after all extensions installation. More complex installers may require special reporter (like jersey extensins installer). Another example, suppose CustomFeature is a base class for our jersey extensions. Then installer will be: public class CustomInstaller implements FeatureInstaller , JerseyInstaller < CustomFeature > { @Override public boolean matches ( final Class <?> type ) { return FeatureUtils . is ( type , CustomFeature . class ); } @Override public void install ( final AbstractBinder binder , final Class < CustomFeature > type ) { JerseyBinding . bindComponent ( binder , type , false , false ); ... } @Override public void report () { ... } } Jersey extensions are more usually complex due to binding aspects (especially for native jersey extensions).

In contrast to dropwizard configuration (file), which is user specific, options are set during development and represent developer decisions. Often, options allow to change opinionated default behaviours. Options are declared with enums. Enums used to naturally group options (also cause pretty reporting). Enums must implement Option interface (this makes enum declaration more verbose (because it is impossible to use abstract class in enum), but provides required option info). Guicey use options to share guice bundle configurations (configured packages to scan, search commands enabling etc) through GuiceyOptions enum (for simplicity, main guicey options usages are already implemented as shortcut methods in guice bundle). Another use is in web installers to change default behaviour though InstallersOptions enum. Custom options may be defined for 3 rd party bundle or even application. Options is a general mechanism providing configuration and access points with standard reporting (part of diagnostic reporting ). It may be used as feature triggers (like guicey do), to enable debug behaviour or to specialize application state in tests (just to name a few). Usage \u00b6 Options may be set only in main GuiceBundle using .option method. This is important to let configuration parts to see the same values. For example, if guicey bundles would be allowed to change options then one bundles would see one value and other bundles - different value and, for sure, this will eventually lead to inconsistent behaviour. Option could not be set to null. Option could be null only if it's default value is null and custom value not set. Custom option value is checked for compatibility with option type (from option definition) and error thrown if does not match. Of course, type checking is limited to top class and generics are ignored (so List<String> could not be specified and so can't be checked), but it's a compromise between complexity and easy of use (the same as Enum & Option pair). Options could be accessed by: Guicey bundles using bootstrap.option() Installer by implementing WithOptions interface Any guice bean could inject Options bean and use it to access options. Guice module could access options by implementing OptionsAwareModule marker interface Guicey tracks options definition and usage and report all used options as part of diagnostic reporting . Pay attention that defined (value set) but not used (not consumed) options are marked as NOT_USED to indicate possibly redundant options. Actual application may use options in different time and so option may be defined as NOT_USE even if its actually \"not yet\" used. Try to consume options closer to actual usage to let user be aware if option not used with current configuration. For example, GuiceyOptions.BindConfigurationInterfaces will not appear in report at all if no custom configuration class used. Custom options \u00b6 Options must be enum and implement Option interface, like this: enum MyOptions implements Option { DoExtraWork ( Boolean , true ), EnableDebug ( Boolean , false ), InternalConfig ( String [] , new String [] { \"one\" , \"two\" , \"three\" }); private Class type private Object value // generic used only to check type - value correctness < T > SampleOptions ( Class < T > type , T value ) { this . type = type this . value = value } @Override public Class getType () { return type } @Override public Object getDefaultValue () { return value } } Each enum value declares option with exact type and default value. Option type is not limited, but implement proper toString for custom object used as option value. This will require for pretty reporting, as simple toString used for option value (except collections and arrays are rendered as []). Now you can use option, for example, in bean: import static MyOptions.DoExtraWork ; public class MyBean { @Inject Options options ; pulic void someMethod () { ... if ( options . get ( DoExtraWork )) { // extra work impl } } } To provide custom option value: GuiceBundle . builder () . option ( DoExtraWork , false ) ... Options lookup \u00b6 Guicey provides simple mapping utility to map properties to system properties, environment variables or simply bind from string (obtained manually somewhere). GuiceBundle . builder () ... . options ( new OptionsMapper () . prop ( \"myprop\" , Myoptions . SomeOption ) . env ( \"STAGE\" , GuiceyOptions . InjectorStage ) . string ( Myoptions . SomeOtherOption , \"property value\" ) . map ()) . build () Here: Myoptions.SomeOption could be changed with \"myprop\" system property ( -Dmyprop=something ) GuiceyOptions.InjectorStage could be changed with environment variable \"STAGE\" Myoptions.SomeOtherOption set from string (string could be obtained somewhere else manually) Important Missed mappings are ignored: e.g. if system property or environment variable is not defined - option will remain with default value (null will not be set!) Supported conversions \u00b6 Each option declares required option type Mapper could automatically convert string to: String Boolean Integer Double Short Byte Enum constant: If option type is exact enum then value must be constant name If option type is generic Enum then value must be 'fullEnumClass.constantName' Array or any type (from above): values must be separated by comma (\"one, two, three\") EnumSet: value must be comma separated list with fully qualified enum constants ('fullEnumClass.constantName') Tip You can use sting conversion directly somewhere else, if required: StringConverter.convert(TargetType, stringValue) Exception is thrown when type is not supported for conversion. In this case use manual converter: new OptionsMapper () . prop ( \"myprop\" , Myoptions . SomeOption , val -> convertVal ( val )) . map () Converter is actually any java.util.Function (here, lambda with method call ( ::convertVal )). System properties \u00b6 As shown before, you can bind single system property to option. But you can allso allow to set any option with system property: new OptionsMapper (). props (). map () It will bind all properties in format: option.enumClasName.enumValue . For example, -Doption.ru.vyarus.dropwizard.guice.GuiceyOptions.UseHkBridge=true Different prefix could be used: .props(\"myprefix\") Warning All properties with matched prefix must be mappable to option (target enum exists), otherwise error will be thrown. If any property requires custom value conversion then bind it before with converter and it will be ignored during mass mapping by prefix: new OptionsMapper () . prop ( \"option.ru.vyarus.dropwizard.guice.GuiceyOptions.UseHkBridge\" , GuiceyOptions . UseHkBridge , val - > convert ( val )) . props () . map () Debug \u00b6 You can enable mapped options print with .printMappings() : new OptionsMapper () . prop ( \"myprop\" , Myoptions . SomeOption , val -> convertVal ( val )) . printMappings () . map () When enabled, all mapped options will be printed to console (logger is not used becuase it's not yet initialized). Example output: env: VAR Opts.OptInt = 1 prop: foo Opts.OptStr = bar Opts.OptBool = true for mapper: new OptionsMapper () . printMappings () . env ( \"VAR\" , Opts . OptInt ) . env ( \"VAR2\" , Opts . OptDbl ) . prop ( \"foo\" , Opts . OptStr ) . prop ( \"foo2\" , Opts . OptShort ) . string ( Opts . OptBool , \"true\" ) . map () Here \"VAR2\" env. variable and \"foo2\" system property wasn't declared and so not mapped. Custom lookup \u00b6 You can directly specify map of options ( .options(Map<Enum, Object>) ) or write your own lookup mechanism: GuiceBundle . builder () . options ( new MyOptionsLookup (). getOptions ()) ... .options() method contract simplified for just Enum , excluding Option for simpler usage, but still only option enums must be provided","title":"Options"},{"location":"guide/options/#options","text":"Options are low level configurations.

Options could be accessed by: Guicey bundles using bootstrap.option() Installer by implementing WithOptions interface Any guice bean could inject Options bean and use it to access options. Guice module could access options by implementing OptionsAwareModule marker interface Guicey tracks options definition and usage and report all used options as part of diagnostic reporting . Pay attention that defined (value set) but not used (not consumed) options are marked as NOT_USED to indicate possibly redundant options. Actual application may use options in different time and so option may be defined as NOT_USE even if its actually \"not yet\" used. Try to consume options closer to actual usage to let user be aware if option not used with current configuration.

This is important because guicey supports multiple instances of the same type. ItemId object equals behaviour may seem non intuitive (see below). For classes ItemId is essentially the same as class: ItemId . from ( SomeClass . class ). equals ( ItemId . from ( SomeClass . class )) == true For instances, item id compute object hash (using System.identityHashCode() ). ItemId could be always created from object instance: ItemId . from ( instance ). equals ( ItemId . from ( instance )) == true but for different instances obviously: ItemId . from ( instance ). equals ( ItemId . from ( otherInstance )) == false But instance identity myst also be recognized by class, because otherwise it is hard to analyze items, so: ItemId . from ( instance . getClass ()). equals ( ItemId . from ( otherInstance )) == true Class identity equals all instance identities of the same class . This allows you to use ItemId.from(MyBundle.class) to get all instance configs for required bundle types. Model \u00b6 Each configuration item is stored using model object. All model classes are inherited from ItemInfo : Model class Description ItemInfo Base class for all models ClassItemInfo Base class for class-based models: extension, installer InstanceItemInfo Base class for instance-based models: bundles, modules ExtensionItemInfo Extension model InstallerItemInfo Installer model ModuleItemInfo Module model GuiceyBundleItemInfo Guicey bundle model DropwizardBundleItemInfo Dropwizard bundle model For example, when you configure extension: . extensions ( MyExtension , class ) Guicey will create new instance of ExtensionItemInfo to store item registration data. For each registered item registration scope is tracked. It could be Application (if item registered in main bundle) Guicey bundle class (for items registered in this bundle) ClasspathScan (for classes from classpath scan) etc .. All scopes are described in ConfigScope enum. Note ItemId is also used for scopes, because we may have multiple bundles of the same type and so need to differentiate them as different scopes. For class based extensions only one model instance will be created for all registrations of the same type . But all registration scopes will be preserved, so it is possible to know all extension duplicate points (and you can see it on diagnostic report ) For instance based extensions , different model instances will be created for different items. So if some object was detected as duplicate , it's id will be only added to original object model ( InstanceItemInfo#getDuplicates() ) to be able to track duplicates. Querying model \u00b6 All raw data is actually available through: GuiceyConfigurationInfo#getData() , but GuiceyConfigurationInfo provides many shortcut methods to simplify raw data querying. Data querying is based on java Predicate usage. Filters class provides common predicate builders. Many examples of it's usage may be found in code. Note For some reports it is important to know only types of used configuration items, ignoring duplicates. Special helper is included directly inside ItemId : ItemId.typesOnly(...) For example, getInstallers() from GuiceyConfigurationInfo : public List < Class < FeatureInstaller >> getInstallers () { return typesOnly ( getData (). getItems ( ConfigItem . Installer , Filters . enabled ())); } More advanced queries are applied with predicate composition: public List < Class < Object >> getExtensionsRegisteredManually () { return typesOnly ( getData (). getItems ( ConfigItem . Extension , Filters . < ExtensionItemInfo > enabled () . and ( it -> it . getRegistrationScopeType (). equals ( ConfigScope . Application ) || it . getRegistrationScopeType (). equals ( ConfigScope . GuiceyBundle )))); } For exact configuration item type you can always get it's configuration model: @Inject GuiceyConfigurationInfo info ; ItemInfo model = info . getInfo ( MyExtension . class ) For instance-based items, you can receive all models for instances of type: List < BundleItemInfo > models = info . getInfos ( MyBundle . class ) And the last example is if you know exact extension instance and wasn't to get it's info: BundleItemInfo model = info . getData (). getInfo ( ItemId . from ( myBundleInstance )) Instances \u00b6 Bundles and modules are configured by instance and this instance is stored in configuration model. For example, to obtain all configured (and not disabled ) guice modules: @Inject GuiceConfigurationInfo info ; List < Module > modules = info . getModuleIds (). stream () . map ( it -> info . getData (). < ModuleItemInfo > getInfo ( it ). getInstance ()) . collect ( Collectors . toList ()); Here all used module ids ( ItemId ) obtained. Then complete configuration model loaded for each item and and instance obtained from model. Note It may look overcomplicated to load ids first and only later obtain instances, but it is actually a restriction of the model: correct registration order is preserved on id level and so this way is the only way to get all instances in registration order. Note Direct model object load by id shortcut was not added directly to GuiceyConfigurationInfo intentionally to avoid mistakes by accidentally using class-based info loading instead of id-based (which may lead to configuration items loss in your reporting or analysis).

For example, getInstallers() from GuiceyConfigurationInfo : public List < Class < FeatureInstaller >> getInstallers () { return typesOnly ( getData (). getItems ( ConfigItem . Installer , Filters . enabled ())); } More advanced queries are applied with predicate composition: public List < Class < Object >> getExtensionsRegisteredManually () { return typesOnly ( getData (). getItems ( ConfigItem . Extension , Filters . < ExtensionItemInfo > enabled () . and ( it -> it . getRegistrationScopeType (). equals ( ConfigScope . Application ) || it . getRegistrationScopeType (). equals ( ConfigScope . GuiceyBundle )))); } For exact configuration item type you can always get it's configuration model: @Inject GuiceyConfigurationInfo info ; ItemInfo model = info . getInfo ( MyExtension . class ) For instance-based items, you can receive all models for instances of type: List < BundleItemInfo > models = info . getInfos ( MyBundle . class ) And the last example is if you know exact extension instance and wasn't to get it's info: BundleItemInfo model = info . getData (). getInfo ( ItemId . from ( myBundleInstance ))","title":"Querying model"},{"location":"guide/diagnostic/configuration-model/#instances","text":"Bundles and modules are configured by instance and this instance is stored in configuration model.

Then complete configuration model loaded for each item and and instance obtained from model. Note It may look overcomplicated to load ids first and only later obtain instances, but it is actually a restriction of the model: correct registration order is preserved on id level and so this way is the only way to get all instances in registration order.

Represents only time spent resolving all classes in configured packages. Guicey will later use this resolved classes to search commands (if enabled), installers and extensions. scanned 5 classes means that 5 classed were found (overall) in configured packages. recognized 4 classes show effectiveness of classpath scanning (how many classes were actually used as installer, extension or command). Note Classpath scan time will be obviously bigger for real applications (with larger classes count). But most of this time spent on class loading (becauase guicey loads all classes during scan and not just parse class structure). If you use all these classes then they will be loaded in any case. If you disable classpath scan to save time then this time will just move to other places (where classes are used).

There are several sections in tree: APPLICATION - for everything registered in GuiceBundle BUNDLES LOOKUP - for bundles resolved with lookup mechanism CLASSPATH SCAN - for items resolved by classpath scan GUICE BINDINGS - for extensions resolved from guice module bindings HOOKS - for registered hooks Markers: DW - dropwizard bundle DISABLED - item manually disabled DUPLICATE - item considered as duplicate for already registered item Disables \u00b6 Manual disable is identified (to quickly understand who disabled item) as: \u251c\u2500\u2500 -disable LifeCycleInstaller (r.v.d.g.m.i.feature) And disabled items would be also identified: \u251c\u2500\u2500 installer -LifeCycleInstaller (r.v.d.g.m.i.feature) *DISABLED Disabled bundles are shown without context (to identify disable): -HK2DebugBundle (r.v.d.g.m.j.debug) *DISABLED De-duplication \u00b6 Duplicate registration or instance de-duplications are identified as: \u251c\u2500\u2500 extension -FooBundleResource (r.v.d.g.d.s.bundle) *DUPLICATE If extension is registered more then once in the same context, it would be identified: \u251c\u2500\u2500 extension FooBundleResource (r.v.d.g.d.s.bundle) \u251c\u2500\u2500 extension -FooBundleResource (r.v.d.g.d.s.bundle) *DUPLICATE If more then one instance (in this context) is considered to be duplicate then number will appear: \u251c\u2500\u2500 extension -FooBundleResource (r.v.d.g.d.s.bundle) *DUPLICATE(3) When multiple instances of the same type is registered (form modules or bundles), they would be numbered in order of registration (to differentiate): APPLICATION \u251c\u2500\u2500 module FooModule (r.v.d.g.d.s.features) ... \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 FooBundleRelative2Bundle (r.v.d.g.d.s.bundle) \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 module FooModule#2 (r.v.d.g.d.s.features) In order to better track duplicates, items, recognized as duplicates, will be shown with registered instance they considered to be duplicate to. For example, for above sample, if another FooModule registered and it would be considered as duplicate to second instance, it would be printed as: \u2514\u2500\u2500 module -FooModule#2 (r.v.d.g.d.s.features) *DUPLICATE Guice bindings \u00b6 Extensions detected from guice bindings are shown as a sub tree: \u251c\u2500\u2500 GUICE BINDINGS \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ModuleWithExtensions (r.v.d.g.d.s.module) \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 extension ModuleFeature (r.v.d.g.d.s.m.ModuleWithExtensions) Note Extensions are shown relative to top-most registered modules! For example, if ModuleWithExtensions internally install module ExtensionModule which actually contains extension bingind, then still ExtensionModule will not be shown and extension will remain under ModuleWithExtensions (on report). This was done to not confuse users: report shows guicey configration and user must clearly see configuration source. Bindings are not shown under main configuration tree (where modules are registered) because guicey know only module class, but actually moduliple module instances could be registered and so it is impossible to known what module instance extension is related to. Tip Detailed guice modules tree could be seen on guice report Customization \u00b6 .printDiagnosticInfo() shortcut register report with default settings. If you need customized report then register report listener directly. For example, installers report is a configured configuration report: . listen ( ConfigurationDiagnostic . builder ( \"Available installers report\" ) . printConfiguration ( new DiagnosticConfig () . printInstallers () . printNotUsedInstallers () . printInstallerInterfaceMarkers ()) . printContextTree ( new ContextTreeConfig () . hideCommands () . hideDuplicateRegistrations () . hideEmptyBundles () . hideExtensions () . hideModules ()) . build ()); Report rendering logic may also be used directly as all sub-reports provide separate renderer object implementing ReportRenderer . Renderers not bound to guice context and assume direct instantiation. For examples of direct renderers usage see events implementation: InjectorPhaseEvent.ReportRenderer","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"guide/diagnostic/configuration-report/#configuration-report","text":"Note During startup guicey records startup metrics and remembers all details of configuration process.

So @Inject @Config MyAbstractConfiguration conf will also work. It is suggested to always use qualifier (to get in common with direct value bindings), but it's up to you. If root configuration classes implement interfaces then configuration could be bound by interface. This may be used to support common Has<Something> configuration interfaces convention used to recognize your extension configuration in configuration object. public interface HasFeatureX { FeatureXConfig getFetureXConfig (); } public class MyConfiguration extends Configuration implements HasFeatureXConfig {...} public class MyBean { @Inject @Config HasFeatureX conf ; ... } Interface binding will ignore interfaces in java.* or groovy.* packages (to avoid unnecessary bindings). Tip Consider using direct sub configuration object binding instead of marker interface if object uniqueness is guaranteed in user configuration. Yaml config introspection \u00b6 Guicey performs Configuration object introspection to provide access for configured yaml values by path or through sub-objects. Warning Additional configuration objects are not bound when yaml introspection is disabled Raw introspection result could be injected directly (for reporting or analysis): @Inject ConfigurationTree tree ; Tip All available configuration bindings could be seen with .printConfigurationBindings() report (use .printAllConfigurationBindings() to see also core dropwizard configuration values). This report is executed before injector creation so use it in cases when injector fail to inject configration value to validate binsinds correctness. Unique objects \u00b6 Unique sub-object (sub configuration classes appeared once) could be injected directly. For example, the following config contains two (custom) unique sub objects: public class MyConfig extends Configuration { @JsonProperty AuthConfig auth ; @JsonProperty DbConfig db ; } Which could be injected directly: @Inject @Config AuthConfig auth ; @Inject @Config DbConfig db ; Tip This is very useful for re-usable modules, which are not aware of your configuration object structure, but require only one sub configuration object: public class MyConfig extends Configuration { @JsonProperty FeatureXConfig featureX ; } Somewhere in module service: public class FeatureXService { @Inject @Config FeatureXConfig featureX ; } Value by path \u00b6 All visible configuration paths values are directly bindable: public class MyConfig extends Configuration { SubConf sub ; } public class SubConf { String smth ; List < String > values ; } @Inject @Config ( \"sub\" ) SubConf sub ; @Inject @Config ( \"sub.smth\" ) String smth ; @Inject @Config ( \"sub.values\" ) List < String > values ; Note Path bindings are available even for null values. For example, if sub configuration object is null, all it's sub paths will still be available (by class declarations). The only exception is conditional mapping like dropwizard server when available paths could change, depending on configuration (what configuration type will be used) Note Generified types are bound only with generics (with all available type information). If you will have SubConf<T> sub in config, then it will be bound with correct generic SubConfig<String> (suppose generic T is declared as String). Value type, declared in configuration class is used for binding, but there are two exceptions. First, if declared type is declared as collection ( Set , List , Map ) implementation then binding will use base collection interface: ArrayList < String > value @Inject @Config ( \"value\" ) List < String > vlaue ; Second, if, for some (unforgivable) reason, property is declared as Object in configuration, then binding type will depend on value presence: @Config(\"path\") Object val - when value is null @Config(\"path\") ValueType val - actual value type, when value is not null It is assumed that in such case value would be always present (some sort of property-selected binding, like dropwizard server ). Tip If provided value bindings are not enough for your case, you can declare your own value bindings: Get introspcetion result object ( ConfigurationTree ) in guice module and bind values the way you need it: public class MyConfigBindingsModule extends DropwizardAwareModule { @Override public void configure () { bind ( String . class ). annotatedWith ( Names . named ( \"db.url\" ), configuration ( \" db . url )); } } Environment binding \u00b6 Dropwizard io.dropwizard.setup.Environment is bound to guice context. It is mostly useful to perform additional configurations in guice bean for features not covered with installers. For example: public class MyBean { @Inject public MyBean ( Environment environment ) { environment . lifecycle (). addServerLifecycleListener ( new ServerLifecycleListener { public void serverStarted ( Server server ) { callSomeMethod (); } }) } } It's not the best example, but it illustrates usage (and such things usually helps to quick-test something).

Overriding modules ( .modulesOverride() ) are ignored (intentionally). Then all not removed bindings are composed to special module (even when no bindings removed, this avoid duplicate modules parsing on injector creation). That means that injector factory receive not user registered modules, but synthetic (with pre-parsed bindings) module instead. Note The most time-consuming operation in analysis is modules parsing, which is actually performed in any case during guice injector creation. You can see this on statistics report : if you switch off analysis injector time will grow. Extensions recognition \u00b6 Guicey can recognize extensions in guice bindings (from configured guice modules). For example, public class MyModule extends AbstractModule { public void configure () { // right parts just for example bind ( MyResource . class ). to ( MyResourceImpl . class ); bind ( MyManaged . class ). toProvider ( MyManagedProvider . class ); } } Guicey will detect MyResource as jersey resource and MyManaged as managed extension. Tip Extensions annotated with @InvisibleForScanner are not recognized, like in clsspath scanner . But note that annotated extensions should not be registered manually ! Because it will lead to default extension binding registration by guicey, which will most likley conflict with existing binding (as a workaround @LazyBinding annotation may be used). Alternatively, you can simply qualify bean and it would not be recognized as extension. This is completely equivalent to GuiceBundle . builder () . extensions ( MyResource . class , MyManaged . class ) Note Internally, the same installers are used for extensions recognition and installation. The only difference is that guicey would not create default bindings for such extensions (because bindings already exists). Restrictions \u00b6 Only direct bindings ( bind(..) ) and linked keys ( bind(..).to(..) ) are checked. Instances are not analyzed ( bind(Something.class).toInstance(new Extension()) ) because extensions supposed to be guice-managed (not strictly required, but will allow to avoid aop-related problems). But, still it is possible to declare not guice managed extension with instance mapping to extension class or provider. Generified ( bind(new TypeLiteral<MyResource<String>(){}) ) and qualified ( bind(MyResource.class).annotatedWith(Qualify.class) ) bindings are ignored (simply because it's not obvious what to do with them). Overriding modules are not checked as they supposed to be used for quick fixes and test mocking. Will be recognized // untargetted binding bind ( Extension . class ) // left side of the link bind ( Extension . class ). to ( Something . class ) // right side of the link bind ( Something . class ). to ( Extension . class ) // left side of instance or provider mapping bind ( Extension . class ). toInstance ( new Extension ()) bind ( Extension . class ). toProvider ( SomeProvider . class ) Will NOT be recognized // instances not analysed bind ( Something . class ). toInstance ( new Extension ()) // extension-recignizable type must be strictly declared bind ( Something . class ). toProvider ( ExtensionProvider . class ) // generified declaration bind ( new TypeLiteral < Extension < Somthing > (){}) // qualified declaration bind ( Extension . class ). annotatedWith ( Qualify . class ) Side note Qualified and generified cases are not supported because they imply that multiple instances of one class may be declared. This rise problems with direct manual declaration: for example, if user declare .extensions(Extension.class) and in module we have bind(Extension.class).annotatedWith(Qualify.class) how can we be sure if its the same declaration or not? Current implementation will not revognize qualified extension and automatically create direct binding ( bind(Extension.class) ). For sure someone will face generified or qualified extensions case, but it would be simplier to workaraund it in exact case, rather then trying to handle all posible cases in general, making everything more complex. Disabled extensions \u00b6 In order to disable extension , recognized from binding, guicey will simply remove this binding. If extension was a part of longer links chain then entire chain would be removed too! For example, bind ( One . class ). to ( Two . class ) bind ( Two . class ). to ( Extension . class ) When Extension disabled One-->Two link is also removed. Motivation: First of all, this avoid error cases when remaining chain part contains only abstract types (e.g. only interfaces remains) Removes possible incosistencies as long chains may appear due to some class overrides and so removing only top (overriding) class will just to \"before override\" state. Removed chains are visible on guice report . Transitive modules \u00b6 During bindings analysis guicey can see binding modules hierarchy (module A install module B which register binding C). Using this guicey can remove all bindings relative to exact module class - the result is the same as if such module was never registered. This is transitive modules disable implementation. Disabling analysis \u00b6 To completely switch off analysis use option: . option ( GuiceyOptions . AnalyzeModules , false ) Warning When analysis is disabled, extensions recognition and transitive modules disables will not work anymore! With disabled analysis injector factory will receive user provided modules directly (instead of pre-parsed synthetic module). Important Enabled analysis completely prevent situations when default binding, created by guciey, conflict with manual binding existing in module. In such case startup will fail.

Guicey extensions completely implemented as junit extensions (and only hook fields are manually searched). Also, guciey extension rely on junit parameters injection. Both options has pros and cons. Extensions \u00b6 Provided extensions: @TestGuiceyApp - for lightweight tests (without starting web part, only guice context) @TestDropwizardApp - for complete integration tests Both extensions allow using injections directly in test fields. Extensions are compatible with parallel execution (no side effects). Alternative declaration is possible. Note Spock and junit5 extensions are almost equivalent in features and behaviour. @TestGuiceyApp \u00b6 @TestGuiceyApp runs all guice logic without starting jetty (so resources, servlets and filters will not be available). Managed objects will still be handled correctly. @TestGuiceyApp ( MyApplication . class ) public class AutoScanModeTest { @Inject MyService service ; @Test public void testMyService () { Assertions . assertEquals ( \"hello\" , service . getSmth ()); } Also, injections work as method parameters: @TestGuiceyApp ( MyApplication . class ) public class AutoScanModeTest { public void testMyService ( MyService service ) { Assertions . assertEquals ( \"hello\" , service . getSmth ()); } Application started before all tests in annotated class and stopped after them. @TestDropwizardApp \u00b6 @TestDropwizardApp is useful for complete integration testing (when web part is required): @TestDropwizardApp ( MyApplication . class ) class WebModuleTest { @Inject MyService service @Test public void checkWebBindings ( ClientSupport client ) { Assertions . assertEquals ( \"Sample filter and service called\" , client . targetMain ( \"servlet\" ). request (). buildGet (). invoke (). readEntity ( String . class )); Assertions . assertTrur ( service . isCalled ()); Random ports \u00b6 In order to start application on random port you can use configuration shortcut: @TestDropwizardApp ( value = MyApplication . class , randomPorts = true ) Note Random ports will be applied even if configuration with exact ports provided: @TestDropwizardApp ( value = MyApplication , config = 'path/to/my/config.yml' , randomPorts = true ) Also, random ports support both server types (default and simple) Real ports could be resolved with ClientSupport object. Rest mapping \u00b6 Normally, rest mapping configured with server.rootMapping=/something/* configuration, but if you don't use custom configuration class, but still want to re-map rest, shortcut could be used: @TestDropwizardApp ( value = MyApplication . class , restMapping = \"something\" ) In contrast to config declaration, attribute value may not start with '/' and end with '/*' - it would be appended automatically. This option is only intended to simplify cases when custom configuration file is not yet used in tests (usually early PoC phase). It allows you to map servlet into application root in test (because rest is no more resides in root). When used with existing configuration file, this parameter will override file definition. Guice injections \u00b6 Any gucie bean may be injected directly into test field: @Inject SomeBean bean This may be even bean not declared in guice modules (JIT injection will occur). To better understand injection scopes look the following test: @TestGuiceyApp ( AutoScanApplication . class ) @TestMethodOrder ( MethodOrderer . OrderAnnotation . class ) public class InjectionScopeTest { // new instance injected on each test @Inject TestBean bean ; // the same context used for all tests (in class), so the same bean instance inserted before each test @Inject TestSingletonBean singletonBean ; @Test @Order ( 1 ) public void testInjection () { bean . value = 5 ; singletonBean . value = 15 ; Assertions . assertEquals ( 5 , bean . value ); Assertions . assertEquals ( 15 , singletonBean . value ); } @Test @Order ( 2 ) public void testSharedState () { Assertions . assertEquals ( 0 , bean . value ); Assertions . assertEquals ( 15 , singletonBean . value ); } // bean is in prototype scope public static class TestBean { int value ; } @Singleton public static class TestSingletonBean { int value ; } } Note Guice AOP will not work on test methods (because test instances not created by guice). Parameter injection \u00b6 Any declared guice bean may be injected as method parameter: @Test public void testSomthing ( DummyBean bean ) (where DummyBean is manually declared in some module or JIT-instantiated during injector creation). For not declared beans injection (JIT) special annotation must be used: @Test public void testSomthing ( @Jit TestBean bean ) Info Additional annotation required because you may use other junit extensions providing their own parameters, which guicey extension should not try to handle. That's why not annotated parameters verified with existing injector bindings. Qualified and generified injections will also work: @Test public void testSomthing ( @Named ( \"qual\" ) SomeBean bean , TestBean < String > generifiedBean , Provider < OtherBean > provider ) Also, there are special objects available as parameters: Application or exact application class ( MyApplication ) ObjectMapper ClientSupport application web client helper Note Parameter injection will work not only in test, but also in lifecyle methods (beforeAll, afterEach etc.) Example: @TestDropwizardApp ( AutoScanApplication . class ) public class ParametersInjectionDwTest { public ParametersInjectionDwTest ( Environment env , DummyService service ) { Preconditions . checkNotNull ( env ); Preconditions . checkNotNull ( service ); } @BeforeAll static void before ( Application app , DummyService service ) { Preconditions . checkNotNull ( app ); Preconditions . checkNotNull ( service ); } @BeforeEach void setUp ( Application app , DummyService service ) { Preconditions . checkNotNull ( app ); Preconditions . checkNotNull ( service ); } @AfterEach void tearDown ( Application app , DummyService service ) { Preconditions . checkNotNull ( app ); Preconditions . checkNotNull ( service ); } @AfterAll static void after ( Application app , DummyService service ) { Preconditions . checkNotNull ( app ); Preconditions . checkNotNull ( service ); } @Test void checkAllPossibleParams ( Application app , AutoScanApplication app2 , Configuration conf , TestConfiguration conf2 , Environment env , ObjectMapper mapper , Injector injector , ClientSupport client , DummyService service , @Jit JitService jit ) { assertNotNull ( app ); assertNotNull ( app2 ); assertNotNull ( conf ); assertNotNull ( conf2 ); assertNotNull ( env ); assertNotNull ( mapper ); assertNotNull ( injector ); assertNotNull ( client ); assertNotNull ( service ); assertNotNull ( jit ); assertEquals ( client . getPort (), 8080 ); assertEquals ( client . getAdminPort (), 8081 ); } public static class JitService { private final DummyService service ; @Inject public JitService ( DummyService service ) { this . service = service ; } } } Client \u00b6 Both extensions prepare special jersey client instance which could be used for web calls. It is mostly useful for complete web tests to call rest services and servlets. @Test void checkRandomPorts ( ClientSupport client ) { Assertions . assertNotEquals ( 8080 , client . getPort ()); Assertions . assertNotEquals ( 8081 , client . getAdminPort ()); } Client object provides: Access to JerseyClient object (for raw calls) Shortcuts for querying main, admin or rest contexts (it will count the current configuration automatically) Shortcuts for base main, admin or rest contexts base urls (and application ports) Example usages: // GET {rest path}/some client . targetRest ( \"some\" ). request (). buildGet (). invoke () // GET {main context path}/servlet client . targetMain ( \"servlet\" ). request (). buildGet (). invoke () // GET {admin context path}/adminServlet client . targetAdmin ( \"adminServlet\" ). request (). buildGet (). invoke () Tip All methods above accepts any number of strings which would be automatically combined into correct path: client . targetRest ( \"some\" , \"other/\" , \"/part\" ) would be correctly combined as \"/some/other/part/\" As you can see test code is abstracted from actual configuration: it may be default or simple server with any contexts mapping on any ports - target urls will always be correct. Response res = client . targetRest ( \"some\" ). request (). buildGet (). invoke () Assertions . assertEquals ( 200 , res . getStatus ()) Assertions . assertEquals ( \"response text\" , res . readEntity ( String )) Also, if you want to use other client, client object can simply provide required info: client . getPort () // app port (8080) client . getAdminPort () // app admin port (8081) client . basePathMain () // main context path (http://localhost:8080/) client . basePathAdmin () // admin context path (http://localhost:8081/) client . basePathRest () // rest context path (http://localhost:8080/) Raw client usage: // call completely external url client . target ( \"http://somedomain:8080/dummy/\" ). request (). buildGet (). invoke () Warning Client object could be injected with both dropwizard and guicey extensions, but in case of guicey extension, only raw client could be used (because web part not started all other methods will throw NPE) Configuration \u00b6 For both extensions you can configure application with external configuration file: @TestGuiceyApp ( value = MyApplication . class , config = \"path/to/my/config.yml\" public class ConfigOverrideTest { Or just declare required values: @TestGuiceyApp ( value = MyApplication . class , configOverride = { \"foo: 2\" , \"bar: 12\" }) public class ConfigOverrideTest { (note that overriding declaration follows yaml format \"key: value\") Or use both at once (here overrides will override file values): @TestGuiceyApp ( value = MyApplication . class , config = ' path / to / my / config . yml ' , configOverride = { \"foo: 2\" , \"bar: 12\" }) class ConfigOverrideTest { Application test modification \u00b6 You can use hooks to customize application . In both extensions annotation hooks could be declared with attribute: @TestDropwizardApp ( value = MyApplication . class , hooks = MyHook . class ) or @TestGuiceyApp ( value = MyApplication . class , hooks = MyHook . class ) Where MyHook is: public class MyHook implements GuiceyConfigurationHook {} Hook fields \u00b6 Alternatively, you can declare hook directly in test static field: @EnableHook static GuiceyConfigurationHook HOOK = builder -> builder . modules ( new DebugModule ()); Any number of fields could be declared. The same way hook could be declared in base test class: public class BaseTest { // hook in base class @EnableHook static GuiceyConfigurationHook BASE_HOOK = builder -> builder . modules ( new DebugModule ()); } @TestGuiceyApp ( value = App . class , hooks = SomeOtherHook . class ) public class SomeTest extends BaseTest { // Another hook @EnableHook static GuiceyConfigurationHook HOOK = builder -> builder . modules ( new DebugModule2 ()); } All 3 hooks will work. Parallel execution \u00b6 Junit parallel tests execution could be activated with properties file junit-platform.properties located at test resources root: junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled = true junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default = concurrent To avoid port collisions in dropwizard tests use randomPorts option . Alternative declaration \u00b6 Both extensions could be declared in static fields: @RegisterExtension static TestDropwizardAppExtension app = TestDropwizardAppExtension . forApp ( AutoScanApplication . class ) . config ( \"src/test/resources/ru/vyarus/dropwizard/guice/config.yml\" ) . configOverrides ( \"foo: 2\" , \"bar: 12\" ) . randomPorts () . hooks ( Hook . class ) . hooks ( builder -> builder . disableExtensions ( DummyManaged . class )) . create (); The only difference with annotations is that you can declare hooks as lambdas directly (still hooks in static fields will also work). @RegisterExtension static TestGuiceyAppExtension app = TestGuiceyAppExtension . forApp ( AutoScanApplication . class ) ... This alternative declaration is intended to be used in cases when guicey exensions need to be aligned with other 3 rd party extensions: in junit you can order extensions declared with annotations (by annotation order) and extensions declared with @RegisterExtension (by declaration order). But there is no way to order extension registered with @RegisterExtension before annotation extension. So if you have 3 rd party extension which needs to be executed BEFORE guicey extensions, you can use field declaration. Junit nested classes \u00b6 Junit natively supports nested tests . Guicey extensions affects all nested tests below declaration (nesting level is not limited): @TestGuiceyApp ( AutoScanApplication . class ) public class NestedPropagationTest { @Inject Environment environment ; @Test void checkInjection () { Assertions . assertNotNull ( environment ); } @Nested class Inner { @Inject Environment env ; // intentionally different name @Test void checkInjection () { Assertions . assertNotNull ( env ); } } } Note Nested tests will use exactly the same guice context as root test (application started only once). Extension declared on nested test will affect all sub-tests: public class NestedTreeTest { @TestGuiceyApp ( AutoScanApplication . class ) @Nested class Level1 { @Inject Environment environment ; @Test void checkExtensionApplied () { Assertions . assertNotNull ( environment ); } @Nested class Level2 { @Inject Environment env ; @Test void checkExtensionApplied () { Assertions . assertNotNull ( env ); } @Nested class Level3 { @Inject Environment envr ; @Test void checkExtensionApplied () { Assertions . assertNotNull ( envr ); } } } } @Nested class NotAffected { @Inject Environment environment ; @Test void extensionNotApplied () { Assertions . assertNull ( environment ); } } } This way nested tests allows you to use different extension configurations in one (root) class. Use interfaces to share tests \u00b6 This is just a tip on how to execute same test method in different environments. public class ClientSupportDwTest { interface ClientCallTest { // test to apply for multiple environments @Test default void callClient ( ClientSupport client ) { Assertions . assertEquals ( \"main\" , client . targetMain ( \"servlet\" ) . request (). buildGet (). invoke (). readEntity ( String . class )); } } @TestDropwizardApp ( App . class ) @Nested class DefaultConfig implements ClientCallTest { @Test void testClient ( ClientSupport client ) { Assertions . assertEquals ( \"http://localhost:8080/\" , client . basePathMain ()); } } @TestDropwizardApp ( value = App . class , configOverride = { \"server.applicationContextPath: /app\" , \"server.adminContextPath: /admin\" , }, restMapping = \"api\" ) @Nested class ChangedDefaultConfig implements ClientCallTest { @Test void testClient ( ClientSupport client ) { Assertions . assertEquals ( \"http://localhost:8080/app/\" , client . basePathMain ()); } } } Here test declared in ClientCallTest interface will be called for each nested test (one declaration - two executions in different environments). Meta annotation \u00b6 You can prepare meta annotation (possibly combining multiple 3 rd party extensions): @Retention ( RetentionPolicy . RUNTIME ) @Target ( ElementType . TYPE ) @TestDropwizardApp ( AutoScanApplication . class ) public @interface MyApp { } @MyApp public class MetaAnnotationDwTest { @Test void checkAnnotationRecognized ( Application app ) { Assertions . assertNotNull ( app ); } } OR you can simply use base test class and configure annotation there: @TestDropwizardApp ( AutoScanApplication . class ) public class BaseTest {} public class ActualTest extends BaseTest {} Dropwizard startup error \u00b6 Warning Tests written in such way CAN'T run in parallel due to System.* modifications. To test application startup fails you can use extensions: junit5-system-exit junit5-capture-system-output-extension testImplementation 'com.ginsberg:junit5-system-exit:1.0.0' testImplementation 'com.github.blindpirate:junit5-capture-system-output-extension:0.1.1' Testing app startup fail: @Test @ExpectSystemExit void checkStartupFail () throws Exception { ErrorApplication . main ( \"server\" ); } With error message validation: @Test @ExpectSystemExit @CaptureSystemOutput void checkStartupFailWithOutput ( CaptureSystemOutput . OutputCapture output ) throws Exception { // assertion declared before! output . expect ( Matchers . containsString ( \"No implementation for java.lang.String annotated with @com.google.inject.name.Named(value=\" )); ErrorApplication . main ( \"server\" ); } 3 rd party extensions integration \u00b6 It is extremely simple in JUnit 5 to write extensions . If you do your own extension, you can easily integrate with guicey or dropwizard extensions: there are special static methods allowing you to obtain main test objects: GuiceyExtensionsSupport.lookupSupport(extensionContext) -> Optional<DropwizardTestSupport> GuiceyExtensionsSupport.lookupInjector(extensionContext) -> Optional<Injector> GuiceyExtensionsSupport.lookupClient(extensionContext) -> Optional<ClientSupport> For example: public class MyExtension implements BeforeEachCallback { @Override public void beforeEach ( ExtensionContext context ) throws Exception { Injector injector = GuiceyExtensionsSupport . lookupInjector ( context ). get (); ... } } (guicey holds test state in junit test-specific storages and that's why test context is required) Warning There is no way in junit to order extensions, so you will have to make sure that your extension will be declared after guicey extension ( @TestGuiceyApp or @TestDropwizardApp ).","title":"Junit 5"},{"location":"guide/test/junit5/#junit-5","text":"Junit 5 user guide You will need the following dependencies (assuming BOM used for versions management): testImplementation 'io.dropwizard:dropwizard-testing' testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api' testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter' Tip If you already have junit4 or spock tests, you can activate vintage engine so all tests could work together with junit 5: testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.vintage:junit-vintage-engine' Note In gradle you need to explicitly activate junit 5 support with test { useJUnitPlatform () ... } Warning Junit 5 annotations are different from junit4, so if you have both junit 5 and junit 4 make sure correct classes (annotations) used for junit 5 tests: import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions ; import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test ;","title":"JUnit 5"},{"location":"guide/test/junit5/#dropwizard-extensions-compatibility","text":"Guicey extensions can be used with dropwizard extenssions.

Junit5 and spock extensions are almost equivalent in features. Junit4 extensions are deprecated (same as dropwizard's own junit4 extensions). All extensions implemented with DropwizardTestSupport . Configuration hooks \u00b6 Guicey provides hooks mechanism to be able to modify application configuration in tests. Using hooks you can disable installers, extensions, guicey bundles or override guice bindings. It may also be useful to register additional extensions (e.g. to validate some internal behaviour). Example hook: public class MyHook implements GuiceyConfigurationHook { public void configure ( GuiceBundle . Builder builder ) { builder . disableModules ( FeatureXModule . class ) . disable ( inPackage ( \"com.foo.feature\" )) . modulesOverride ( new MockDaoModule ()) . option ( Myoptions . DebugOption , true ); } } Note You can modify options in hook and so could enable some custom debug/monitoring options specifically for test. There are special spock and junit extensions for hooks registrations. Disables \u00b6 You can use hooks to disable all not needed features in test: installers extensions guice modules guicey bundles dropwizard bundles This way you can isolate (as much as possible) some feature for testing. The most helpful should be bundles disable (if you use bundles for features grouping) and guice modules. Use predicate disabling . Note It is supposed that disabling will be used instead of mocking - you simply remove what you don't need and register replacements, if required. Guice bindings override \u00b6 It is quite common requirement to override bindings for testing. For example, you may want to mock database access. Guicey could use guice Modules.override() to help you override required bindings. To use it prepare module only with changed bindings (bindings that must override existing). For example, you want to replace ServiceX. You have few options: If it implement interface, implement your own service and bind as bind(ServiceContract.class).to(MyServiceXImpl.class) If service is a class, you can modify its behaviour with extended class bind(ServiceX.class).to(MyServiceXExt.class) Or you can simply register some mock instance bind(ServiceX.class).toInstance(myMockInstance) public class MyOverridingModule extends AbstractModule { protected configure () { bind ( ServiceX . class ). to ( MyServiceXExt . class ); } } And register overriding module in hook: public class MyHook implements GuiceyConfigurationHook { public void configure ( GuiceBundle . Builder builder ) { builder . modulesOverride ( new MyOverridingModule ()); } } Debug bundles \u00b6 You can also use special guicey bundles, which modify application behaviour. Bundles could contain additional listeners or services to gather additional metrics during tests or validate behaviour. For example, guicey tests use bundle to enable restricted guice options like disableCircularProxies . Bundles are also able to: disable installers, extensions, gucie modules override guice bindings You can also use lookup mechanism to load bundles in tests. For example, system properties lookup . Overriding overridden beans \u00b6 Guicey provides direct support for overriding guice bindings , so in most cases you don't need to do anything. But, if you use this to override application bindings need to override such bindings in test (again), then you may use provided custom injector factory : Register factory in guice bundle: GuiceBundle . builder () . injectorFactory ( new BindingsOverrideInjectorFactory ()) After that you can register overriding bindings (which will override even modules registered in modulesOverride ) with: BindingsOverrideInjectorFactory . override ( new MyOverridingModule ()) Important It is assumed that overrding modules registration and application initialization will be at the same thread ( ThreadLocal used for holding registered modules to allow parallel tests usage). For example, suppose we have some service CustomerService and it's implementation CustomerServiceImpl , defined in some 3 rd party module.

You will need the following dependencies (assuming BOM used for versions management): testImplementation 'io.dropwizard:dropwizard-testing' testImplementation 'org.objenesis:objenesis:3.1' testImplementation 'cglib:cglib-nodep:3.3.0' testImplementation 'org.spockframework:spock-core' OR you can use it with junit 5 vintage engine: testImplementation 'io.dropwizard:dropwizard-testing' testImplementation 'org.objenesis:objenesis:3.1' testImplementation 'cglib:cglib-nodep:3.3.0' testImplementation 'org.spockframework:spock-core' testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api' testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter' testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.vintage:junit-vintage-engine' This way you can write both spock (groovy) and junit 5 (java or groovy) tests. Extensions \u00b6 Provided extensions: @UseGuiceyApp - for lightweight tests (without starting web part, only guice context) @UseDropwizardApp - for complete integration tests Both extensions allow using injections directly in specifications (like spock-guice). @UseGuiceyHooks extension could be used to apply configuration hook common for all tests. But, it is deprecated in favor of native hooks support in main extensions. Note Spock and junit5 extensions are almost equivalent in features and behaviour. Differences: Obviously different extension annotations, but completely the same attributes and behaviour Spock does not support test method parameters injections, so everything injected with fields (including ClientSupport object). Config override syntax (spock extension use legacy syntax, which will change in the next breaking release) @UseGuiceyApp \u00b6 @UseGuiceyApp runs all guice logic without starting jetty (so resources, servlets and filters will not be available). Managed objects will still be handled correctly. @UseGuiceyApp ( MyApplication ) class AutoScanModeTest extends Specification { @Inject MyService service def \"My service test\" { when: 'calling service' def res = service . getSmth () then: 'correct result returned' res == 'hello' } Application started before all tests in annotated class and stopped after them. @UseDropwizardApp \u00b6 @UseDropwizardApp is useful for complete integration testing (when web part is required): @UseDropwizardApp ( MyApplication ) class WebModuleTest extends Specification { @Inject MyService service def \"Check web bindings\" () { when: \"calling filter\" def res = new URL ( \"http://localhost:8080/dummyFilter\" ). getText () then: \"filter active\" res == 'Sample filter and service called' service . isCalled () Random ports \u00b6 In order to start application on random port you can use configuration shortcut: @UseDropwizardApp ( value = MyApplication , randomPorts = true ) Note Random ports will be applied even if configuration with exact ports provided: @UseDropwizardApp ( value = MyApplication , config = 'path/to/my/config.yml' , randomPorts = true ) Also, random ports support both server types (default and simple) Real ports could be resolved with ClientSupport object. Rest mapping \u00b6 Normally, rest mapping configured with server.rootMapping=/something/* configuration, but if you don't use custom configuration class, but still want to re-map rest, shortcut could be used: @UseDropwizardApp ( value = MyApplication , restMapping = \"something\" ) In contrast to config declaration, attribute value may not start with '/' and end with '/*' - it would be appended automatically. This option is only intended to simplify cases when custom configuration file is not yet used in tests (usually early PoC phase). It allows you to map servlet into application root in test (because rest is no more resides in root). When used with existing configuration file, this parameter will override file definition. Guice injections \u00b6 Any gucie bean may be injected directly into test field: @Inject SomeBean bean This may be even bean not declared in guice modules (JIT injection will occur). To better understand injection scopes look the following test: @UseGuiceyApp ( AutoScanApplication ) class InjectionTest extends Specification { // instance remain the same between tests @Shared @Inject TestBean sharedBean // new instance injected on each test @Inject TestBean bean // the same context used for all tests (in class), so the same bean instance inserted before each test @Inject TestSingletonBean singletonBean def \"Check injection types\" () { when: \"changing state of injected beans\" sharedBean . value = 10 bean . value = 5 singletonBean . value = 15 then: \"instances are different\" sharedBean . value == 10 bean . value == 5 singletonBean . value == 15 } def \"Check shared state\" () { expect: \"shared bean instance is the same, whereas other one re-injected\" sharedBean . value == 10 bean . value == 0 singletonBean . value == 15 // the same instance was set before second test } // bean is in prototype scope static class TestBean { int value } @Singleton static class TestSingletonBean { int value } } Note Guice AOP will not work on test methods (because test instances not created by guice). Client \u00b6 Both extensions prepare special jersey client instance which could be used for web calls. It is mostly useful for complete web tests to call rest services and servlets. @InjectClient ClientSupport client It will also work in static fields or @Shared fields. Client object provides: Access to JerseyClient object (for raw calls) Shortcuts for querying main, admin or rest contexts (it will count the current configuration automatically) Shortcuts for base main, admin or rest contexts base urls (and application ports) Example usages: // GET {rest path}/some client . targetRest ( \"some\" ). request (). buildGet (). invoke () // GET {main context path}/servlet client . targetMain ( \"servlet\" ). request (). buildGet (). invoke () // GET {admin context path}/adminServlet client . targetAdmin ( \"adminServlet\" ). request (). buildGet (). invoke () Tip All methods above accepts any number of strings which would be automatically combined into correct path: client . targetRest ( \"some\" , \"other/\" , \"/part\" ) would be correctly combined as \"/some/other/part/\" As you can see test code is abstracted from actual configuration: it may be default or simple server with any contexts mapping on any ports - target urls will always be correct. when: \"calling rest service\" def res = client . targetRest ( \"some\" ). request (). buildGet (). invoke () then: \"response is correct\" res . status == 200 res . readEntity ( String ) == \"response text\" Also, if you want to use other client, client object can simply provide required info: client . getPort () // app port (8080) client . getAdminPort () // app admin port (8081) client . basePathMain () // main context path (http://localhost:8080/) client . basePathAdmin () // admin context path (http://localhost:8081/) client . basePathRest () // rest context path (http://localhost:8080/) Raw client usage: // call completely external url client . target ( \"http://somedomain:8080/dummy/\" ). request (). buildGet (). invoke () Warning Client object could be injected with both dropwizard and guicey extensions, but in case of guicey extension, only raw client could be used (because web part not started all other methods will throw NPE) Configuration \u00b6 For both extensions you can configure application with external configuration file: @UseGuiceyApp ( value = MyApplication , config = 'path/to/my/config.yml' class ConfigOverrideTest extends Specification { Or just declare required values: @UseGuiceyApp ( value = MyApplication , configOverride = [ @ConfigOverride ( key = \"foo\" , value = \"2\" ), @ConfigOverride ( key = \"bar\" , value = \"12\" ) ]) class ConfigOverrideTest extends Specification { Or use both at once (here overrides will override file values): @UseGuiceyApp ( value = MyApplication , config = 'path/to/my/config.yml' , configOverride = [ @ConfigOverride ( key = \"foo\" , value = \"2\" ), @ConfigOverride ( key = \"bar\" , value = \"12\" ) ]) class ConfigOverrideTest extends Specification { Application test modification \u00b6 You can use hooks to customize application . In both extensions annotation hooks could be declared with attribute: @UseDropwizardApp ( value = MyApplication , hooks = MyHook ) or @UseGuiceyApp ( value = MyApplication , hooks = MyHook ) Where MyHook is: class MyHook implements GuiceyConfigurationHook {} Hook fields \u00b6 Alternatively, you can declare hook directly in test static field: @EnableHook static GuiceyConfigurationHook HOOK = { it . modules ( new DebugModule ()) } Any number of fields could be declared. The same way hook could be declared in base test class: class BaseTest extends Specification { // hook in base class @EnableHook static GuiceyConfigurationHook BASE_HOOK = { it . modules ( new DebugModule ()) } } @UseGuiceyApp ( value = App , hooks = SomeOtherHook ) class SomeTest extends BaseTest { // Another hook @EnableHook static GuiceyConfigurationHook HOOK = { it . modules ( new DebugModule2 ()) } } All 3 hooks will work. Hooks extension \u00b6 Warning This extension is deprecated in favour of field hooks declarations. @UseGuiceyHooks ( MyBaseHook ) class BaseTest extends Specification { } @UseGuiceyApp ( App ) class SomeTest extends BaseTest {} Note You can still use test specific hooks together with declared base hook (to apply some more test-specific configuration). Warning Only one @UseGuiceyHooks declaration may be used in test hierarchy: for example, you can't declare it in base class and then another one on extended class - base for a group of tests. This is spock limitation (only one extension will actually work) but should not be an issue for most cases. Dropwizard startup error \u00b6 Warning StartupErrorRule is deprecated, but as spock still depends on junit4 (waiting for spock2) there are no alternatives. StartupErrorRule may be used to intercept dropwizard System . exit ( 1 ) call. But it will work different then for junit: then section is always called with exception ( CheckExitCalled ). Also, then section may be used for assertion after exit calls and so there is no need to add custom assertion callbacks (required by junit tests). class ErrorTest extends Specification { @Rule StartupErrorRule RULE = StartupErrorRule . create () def \"Check startup error\" () { when: \"starting app with error\" new MyErrApp (). main ([ 'server' ]) then: \"startup failed\" thrown ( RULE . indicatorExceptionType ) RULE . output . contains ( 'stating application' ) RULE . error . contains ( 'some error occur' ) Spock lifecycle hooks \u00b6 class MyTest extends Specification { @ClassRule @Shared JunitRule sharedRule = new JunitRule () @Rule JunitRule2 rule = new JunitRule2 () def setupSpec () { } def setup () { } def \"Test method body\" () { setup: } } Class rules are applied once per test class (same as setupSpec ).

Or you can enable HK2 management for jersey extensions by default . Note that this will affect resources too and guice aop will not work on jersey extensions.

For more details see org.glassfish.jersey.internal.inject.Providers#getAllServiceHolders( org.glassfish.jersey.internal.inject.InjectionManager, java.lang.Class) which is used by jersey for providers loading. Tip Previously (<= 5.1.0) guicey were not qualifying providers and qualification may (unlikely, but can!) introduce behaviour changes on guicey upgrade (due to prioritized custom providers). In this case, auto qualification may be disabled with . option ( InstallerOptions . PrioritizeJerseyExtensions , false ) to revert to legacy guicey behaviour. @Custom may be used directly in this case on some providers for prioritization. @Priority annotation may be used for ordering providers. Value should be > 0 (but may be negative, just a convention). For example, 1000 is more prioritized then 2000. See javax.ws.rs.Priorities for default priority constants. Note @Priority may work differently on @Custom qualified providers (all user providers by default) and unqualified (e.g. registered through hk module, like dropwizard defaults).
