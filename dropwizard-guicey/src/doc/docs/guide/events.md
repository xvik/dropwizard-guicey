# Guicey lifecycle events

Guicey broadcast lifecycle events in all major points. Each event 
provides access to all available state at this point.

Events could be used for configuration analysis, reporting or to add some special 
post processing for configuration items (e.g. post process modules before injector creation). 

!!! important
    Event listeners could not modify configuration itself
    (can't add new extensions, installers, bundles or disable anything).   

## Events

All events are listed in `GuiceyLifecycle` enum (in execution order).

ManualExtensionsValidated^**?**^ | Called when all manually registered extension classes are recognized by installers (validated). But only extensions, known to be enabled at that time are actually validated (this way it is possible to exclude extensions for non existing installers). Called only if at least one manual extension registered.                                                                    | Logging, assertions

BundlesStarted^**?**^ | Called after bundles start (run method call). Not called if no bundles were used at all. Called only if bindings analysis is not disabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Logging

Always called.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Logging. Note that it is useless to modify module instance here, because they were already processed.
**Guice injector created** |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 
ExtensionsInstalledBy | Called when installer installed all related extensions (for each installer) and only for installers actually performed installations (extensions list never empty). Note: jersey extensions are processed later.                                                                                                                                                                      | Logging of installed extensions. Extension instance could be obtained from injector and post processed.
ExtensionsInstalled^**?**^ | Called after all installers install related extensions.

ApplicationRun | Meta event, called when guice injector started, extensions installed (except jersey extensions because neither jersey nor jetty would be started yet) and all guice singletons initialized. At this point injection to registered commands is performed (this may be important if custom command run application instead of "server"). Point is just before `Application.run` method. | Ideal point for jersey and jetty listeners installation (with shortcut methods in event).
**Jersey initialization** |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
ApplicationStarting | Meta event, called after application run method, but before web server startup (called for lightweight tests)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | It is used for starting lightweight jersey context (in stub rest).
JerseyConfiguration | Jersey context starting. Both jersey and jetty are starting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | First point where jersey's `InjectionManager` (and `ServiceLocator`) become available
JerseyExtensionsInstalledBy | Called when jersey installer installed all related extensions (for each installer) and only for installers actually performed installations (extensions list never empty)                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Logging of installed extensions. Extension instance could be obtained from injector/locator and post processed.
JerseyExtensionsInstalled^**?**^ | Called after all jersey installers install related extensions. Not called when no installed extensions (nothing registered or all disabled).

## Listeners

Events listener registration: 

```java
GuiceBundle.builder()
    .listen(new MyListener(), new MyOtherListener())
    ...
    .build()
```

!!! note
    Listeners could be also registered in guicey bundle, but they will not receive all events:
    
    * `>= BundlesInitialized` for listeners registered in initialization method 
    * `>= BundlesStarted` for listeners registered in run method  

Event listener could implement generic event interface `GuiceyLifecycleListener` and use
enum to differentiate required events:

```java
public class MyListener implements GuiceyLifecycleListener {
    
    public void onEvent(GuiceyLifecycleEvent event) {
        switch (event.getType()) {
            case InjectorCreation:
                InjectorCreationEvent e = (InjectorCreationEvent) event;
                ...
        }
    }
}  
```

Or use `GuiceyLifecycleAdapter` adapter and override only required methods:

```java
public class MyListener extends GuiceyLifecycleAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void injectorCreation(final InjectorCreationEvent event) {
           ...
    }        
}
``` 

!!! tip
    In `ApplicationStarted` and `ApplicationShutdown` events lightweight guicey test
    environment may be differentiated from real server startup with `.isJettyStarted()` method.

### De-duplication

Event listeners are also support de-duplication to prevent unnecessary  duplicates usage
(for example, two bundles may register one listener because they are not always used together).
But it is **not the same mechanism** as configuration items de-duplication.

Simply listeners are registered in the `LinkedHashSet` and so listeners could control de-duplication
with a proper `equals` and `hashCode` implementations

Many reports use this feature (because all of them are based on listeners). For example,
[diagnostic report](diagnostic/configuration-report.md) use the following implementations:

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(final Object obj) {
    // allow only one instance with the same title
    return obj instanceof ConfigurationDiagnostic
            && reportTitle.equals(((ConfigurationDiagnostic) obj).reportTitle);
}

@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return reportTitle.hashCode();
}
```

And with it, `.printDiagnosticInfo()` can be called multiple times and still only one report
will be actually printed.

### Events hierarchy

All event classes inherit from some base event classes. Base event classes are extending each other:
as lifecycle phases go, more objects become available. So you can access any available (at this point) object
from event instance. 

Base event | Description 
-----------|-------------
GuiceyLifecycleEvent | The lowest event type. Provides access to event type and options.
ConfigurationPhaseEvent | Initialization phase event. Provides access to Bootstrap.  
RunPhaseEvent | Dropwizard run phase. Provides access to Configuration, ConfigurationTree, Environment. Shortcut for configuration bindings report renderer
InjectorPhaseEvent | Guice injector created. Available injector and GuiceyConfigurationInfo (guicey configuration). Shortcuts for configuration reports renderer 
JerseyPhaseEvent | Jersey starting. Jersey's `InjectionManager` available.
