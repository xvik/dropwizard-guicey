 * Configuration items may be registered by class (extension, installer) or by instance (guicey bundle, guice module).
 * Duplicates are obvious for class registrations: one class - one extension instance (no matter how much times
 * this class was registered). But for instances it's not so obvious. For example, in dropwizard you can
 * register multiple instances of the same bundle (and it's often very useful!). But, sometimes,
 * there are common bundles (or guice modules), used by multiple other bundles (and so declared by all of them).
 * In this case it would be desirable to register common bundle just once (and avoid duplicate).
 * <p>
 * Default deduplication logic for instances will consider equal objects as duplicate. In cases, when it is impossible
 * to properly implement equals method (e.g. 3rd party class), custom deduplication detector could be implemented.
